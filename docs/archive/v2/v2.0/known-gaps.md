# Known Gaps - v2.0

**Project**: Nexus AI Studio
**Status**: in-progress
**Last updated**: 2026-08-20 (develop follow-up after v2.1.0; no retag)

Per-version tracker of unfinished work, deferrals, and follow-ups. The next `/plan` ingests this file to decide what carries forward. Classifications: `NI` not-implemented, `DF` deferred, `BG` bug/known-issue, `MT` missing-tests/coverage, `WN` warning/suppressed, `QG` bypassed-gate/CI.

Plan: [plans/v2.0.0-adoption-governed-autonomy-multimodal.md](plans/v2.0.0-adoption-governed-autonomy-multimodal.md)

Phase 5 reconciliation: v1.15-v1.18 files are finalized and remain canonical. Still-open v1.19 and v1.20 rows stay in those files and are indexed below. This file owns v2.0.0 cycle gaps plus the named transfers from the Phase 5.2 prompt.

### Open Items

#### Deferred

##### DF-1 - Native audio-token reasoning is not wired

- **Source phase**: Phase 1 - Audio attachment + transcribe-then-chat (1.2)
- **Plan reference**: `docs/archive/v2/v2.0/plans/v2.0.0-adoption-governed-autonomy-multimodal.md` (sub-task 1.2)
- **Reason**: The plan keeps native audio-token reasoning out of scope until a fitting local model exists. Transcribe-then-chat is the only audio path. Catalog `modalities` including `audio` only changes the composer tooltip.
- **Suggested next step**: When a local model that accepts audio tokens is catalogued, route clips as native audio instead of (or in addition to) labelled transcripts.

##### DF-6 - Playwright is an optional local install, not a lockfile pin

- **Source phase**: Phase 2 - Browser tool family (2.2)
- **Plan reference**: `docs/archive/v2/v2.0/plans/v2.0.0-adoption-governed-autonomy-multimodal.md` (sub-task 2.2)
- **Reason**: Adding Playwright to `package.json` would make `npm ci` in CI download Chromium. Tests use `InMemoryBrowser` and a fake loader. The documented pin is Playwright 1.55.x via `npx playwright@1.55.0 install chromium`.
- **Suggested next step**: If a nightly job can cache browsers, add `playwright` as an optionalDependency with that pin and keep CI on InMemory.

##### DF-8 - LongCat Avatar DiT inference is not vendored

- **Source phase**: Phase 3 - audio2video avatar mode (3.2)
- **Plan reference**: `docs/archive/v2/v2.0/plans/v2.0.0-adoption-governed-autonomy-multimodal.md` (sub-task 3.2)
- **Reason**: The required byte-level scan of an imported LongCat inference tree found no tree to import. Shipping un-scanned upstream `.py` would violate the precondition. CI and the adapter run the existing stub executor. Official INT8 shards are sha256-pinned in the catalog for a later scanned import.
- **Suggested next step**: Scan `meituan-longcat/LongCat-Video` (bucket-3 strip), then wire the INT8 loader behind `longcat_avatar.preflight` on a diffusion-pro host. Record GPU evidence; do not treat the stub as a live talking-head.

##### DF-9 - Continuation seam quality is unmeasured

- **Source phase**: Phase 3 - video continuation (3.1)
- **Plan reference**: `docs/archive/v2/v2.0/plans/v2.0.0-adoption-governed-autonomy-multimodal.md` (sub-task 3.1)
- **Reason**: Chaining UX and `continueFrom` payloads ship. No Wan 2.2 GPU run measured temporal seams between segments. Extra field `seamQuality` is `prototype-unmeasured`.
- **Suggested next step**: On a host with Wan 2.2 weights, generate a 3-segment clip and document visible seam artefacts before calling continuation production-quality.

##### DF-10 - Code-as-action sandbox and Query DSL are not built

- **Source phase**: Phase 4 - Code-as-action sandbox + Query DSL (4.3)
- **Plan reference**: `docs/archive/v2/v2.0/plans/v2.0.0-adoption-governed-autonomy-multimodal.md` (sub-task 4.3)
- **Reason**: `core/project/codeAsAction.ts` is a fail-closed kernel (opt-in, no fs, no network, no interpreter). Query DSL and a hardened isolate are not built. JSON tool calls remain the default.
- **Suggested next step**: Arm an isolate that evaluates `source` under the same fail-closed contract, then add Query DSL. Mutating operations must still pass PermissionTiers and ConfirmationGate.

##### DF-11 - Fast small-model command router is not built

- **Source phase**: Phase 4 - Fast small-model command router (4.4)
- **Plan reference**: `docs/archive/v2/v2.0/plans/v2.0.0-adoption-governed-autonomy-multimodal.md` (sub-task 4.4)
- **Reason**: `modules/coding/routing/commandRouter.ts` classifies a few short imperatives when `enabled` is true and abstains otherwise. It is not wired into AgentLoop. No before/after latency number exists. Callers still own ConfirmationGate at the normal tier.
- **Suggested next step**: Wire the opt-in classifier at a composition root, keep abstain-and-escalate, and record a latency number versus the full AgentLoop. Do not drop permission tiers.

##### DF-12 - VRM Chat presence pane is not built

- **Source phase**: Phase 4 - VRM avatar presence layer (4.7)
- **Plan reference**: `docs/archive/v2/v2.0/plans/v2.0.0-adoption-governed-autonomy-multimodal.md` (sub-task 4.7)
- **Reason**: The plan ships this only if Chat demand justifies it. No Chat demand was observed this cycle. Live2D stays rejected (proprietary Cubism Core). Depends on Phase 1.3 TTS timing for lip-sync.
- **Suggested next step**: If Chat users ask for a presence pane, add an optional three-vrm renderer, off by default, VRM only, local, with zero cost when disabled.

##### DF-13 - Inkling-Small GGUF stays text-only (v1.19.2 DF-2)

- **Source phase**: Phase 5 - Known-gaps reconciliation (5.2); origin v1.19.2 task 1.6
- **Plan reference**: `docs/archive/v1/v1.19/plans/v1.19.2-adoption-catalog-and-model-expansion.md` (sub-task 1.6)
- **Reason**: Native Inkling-Small accepts text, image, and audio. The curated UD-IQ1_S GGUF has no verified llama.cpp multimodal projector. Catalog `modalities` is `["text"]`.
- **Suggested next step**: Add image/audio modalities only after a dated local load of an image and an audio clip on that GGUF. Keep the row out of `recommended.json`.

##### DF-14 - Kimi K3 is not a catalog LLM entry

- **Source phase**: Phase 5 - Known-gaps reconciliation (5.2); origin kimi-k3-in-c K4
- **Plan reference**: `docs/archive/v2/v2.0/comparisons/v2.0.6-comparison-kimi-k3-in-c.md` (K4)
- **Reason**: v1.19.2 calibrated the patient tier. A Kimi K3 row waits on a GGUF in the Ollama-wrapped lineage. The C99 engine from kimi-k3-in-c stays rejected.
- **Suggested next step**: If an Ollama-served GGUF lands with a pin, add a patient-tier catalog row. Do not vendor the C engine or the 1.56 TB checkpoint.

### Carry-forward index (v1.15 through v1.20)

Canonical detail stays in the source file. v2.0 does not close these unless listed under Resolved.

| Source | Status of that file | What v2.0 does |
|---|---|---|
| [v1.15](../../v1/v1.15/known-gaps.md) | finalized | Installer mypy/NSIS/on-device QA rows stay there |
| [v1.16](../../v1/v1.16/known-gaps.md) | finalized | Gateway/OCR/MLX smokes stay there; parse_document composition moved to v1.20 then DF-1 here via v1.20 DF-1 |
| [v1.17](../../v1/v1.17/known-gaps.md) | finalized | Motion/Tailwind/installer-motion stay there. `asr-capture` now used on Chat voice capture; web-search activity remains mapping-only |
| [v1.18](../../v1/v1.18/known-gaps.md) | finalized | Remaining: llama-server smoke, Hub CI, Windows sandbox partial, harness default off, ... Overlay, badge `(off)`, catalog chip, and fail-closed `mcp.invoke` resolved in the v2.1 follow-up |
| [v1.19](../../v1/v1.19/known-gaps.md) | in-progress | Tool-format dispatch, persona field, Headless LoopGuards, and DANGEROUS clamp resolved in the v2.1 follow-up. Inkling multimodal is DF-13 here |
| [v1.20](../../v1/v1.20/known-gaps.md) | in-progress | Remaining: Docling defer (DF-5), ocr dir name (DF-6). Sidecar ingest is an in-process array (DF-1 resolved; no second SQLite) |

### Resolved

| ID | Title | Resolved in | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| OW-A2 scheduler | OpenWorker A2 local scheduler | v1.18.0 Phase 4 | `AgentRunScheduler` plus ask inbox. Morning-brief schedule remains off by default. Not re-opened in v2.0 |
| DF-2 | Chat RapidOCR of raster images on text-only | v2.1.0 follow-up | PNG/JPEG still attach for RapidOCR when `imageEnabled` is false. GIF still dropped. |
| DF-3 | Voice-loop RMS VAD | v2.1.0 follow-up | `micRecorder.ts` dispatches speech/silence from an AnalyserNode RMS threshold. jsdom still has no live energy path. |
| DF-4 | Kokoro float32 clipped to int16 | v2.1.0 follow-up | `float32_pcm_to_int16_le` before `_wrap_wav`. Live Kokoro playback unproven (`NEXUS_AUDIO_STUB=1` in CI). |
| DF-5 | Chat STT transcripts indexed | v2.1.0 sweep | Chat-scoped `InMemoryMemoryHub` records redacted STT text (`chat-stt`). Sidecar coding ingest is now an in-process array (v1.20 DF-1). |
| DF-7 | 15-tool cap hid `browser_*` | v2.1.0 follow-up | Cap is 20. Browser family trims after `codegraph_*` so symbol tools win first. |
| MT-1 | ChildProcessAudioRuntime timeout/malformed lines | v2.1.0 sweep | Spawn fakes cover timeout, child-exit, and a non-JSON stdout line. |

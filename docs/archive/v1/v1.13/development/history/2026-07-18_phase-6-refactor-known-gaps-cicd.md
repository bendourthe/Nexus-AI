# Session History - v1.13.0 Phase 6 (terminal): Architecture refactor, known-gaps, CI/CD

**Date**: 2026-07-18
**Plan**: [../../plans/installer-reliability-and-ux.md](../../plans/installer-reliability-and-ux.md) - Phase 6 (final)
**Branch**: `feat/v1.13.0-installer-reliability`

## Goal

Leave the cycle well-organized, its known gaps reconciled, and CI/CD complete; then run the release-readiness handoff (verification only - no auto tag/push).

## Subtasks

- **6.1 - Architecture refactor.** Near-no-op. The cycle's new modules (`engine/model_preflight.py`, `widgets/gradient_wordmark.py`) and per-phase tests sit in the correct trees; no deprecated files, empty directories, duplicates, or non-version orphans were introduced, and no stray `TODO`/`FIXME`/`# DEVIATION` markers remain in the changed code. `docs/archive/v1/v1.13/` is canonical (`plans/`, `known-gaps.md`, `development/history/` with all six phase histories).
- **6.2 - Known-gaps reconciliation.** All 11 open items triaged and kept with accurate reasons: live-run verification (IR.P1.A / IR.P2.A / IR.P1.E) gated by the Actions freeze + a real Ollama; SHA-pin rotation (IR.P1.B), gated re-point (IR.P1.C), the thin-CLI test (IR.P2.C), the installer README (IR.P2.B), and on-device visual QA / icon polish (IR.P3.A / IR.P4.A / IR.P5.A). None block the code. A Phase 6 reconciliation block was added to the ledger.
- **6.3 - CI/CD.** The installer pytest job in `ci.yml` auto-covers the new test files; the Phase-2 reachability job on `installer-smoke.yml` is freeze-safe (dispatch/monthly cron). No new job required; no minute-bloat added.
- **6.4 - Testing and stabilization.** Static gates green (tsc -b; eslint src modules; check-architecture 0 errors + 10 pre-existing warnings; check:tampering 0 findings; security:check in sync). Full installer pytest green; desktop Sidebar green; root suite 4637 passed / 6 skipped. The 2 full-suite failures were `golden-runner-end-to-end.test.ts` timeouts that PASS in isolation (3/3) - load-induced flakiness in the coding-pillar golden runner, unrelated to this installer cycle (ENV flake, not a regression).

## Release readiness (9A / 9B / 9C-9E)

- **9A**: known gaps reconciled (above); no release-blocker among them.
- **9B**: tests + CI/CD verified (above).
- **9C-9E**: handed to `/update release`. NOT auto-tagged/pushed. This repo cuts releases via semantic-release on merge to `main`; the actual cut is blocked by the GitHub Actions budget freeze until ~2026-08-01 (identical to the v2.2.0 situation). Operator decisions: push the branch, open PR -> develop -> main, and re-run the frozen release workflow once the budget is restored.

## Outcome

v1.13.0 is code-complete across all 6 phases: the fresh-install half-failure is fixed and preflighted, the brand wordmark + installer UX match the mockup, and the cycle is reconciled + gated. Ready for `/update release` once the freeze lifts.

# Development Log: Phase 6 Architecture Refactor, Known-Gaps, and CI/CD (FINAL)

**Date**: 2026-08-16
**Operator**: Nexus contributor
**Assisted by**: Cursor Grok 4.6
**Objective**: Leave the project well-organized, its known gaps reconciled, and its CI/CD complete and optimized, then hand version bump / changelog / tag / push to `/update release`.
**Outcome**: Complete. All four quality gates passed without bypass. `is_final_phase` is true. Nothing auto-tagged or pushed.

---

## 1. Starting State

- **Branch**: `develop` (ahead of origin by 4 commits after Phase 5)
- **Starting tag/commit**: `b28915a` (Phase 5 motion coordination)
- **Environment**: Windows 10, Node workspace `@nexus/desktop`, Vitest + jsdom
- **Prior session reference**: [2026-08_phase-5-motion-coordination.md](2026-08_phase-5-motion-coordination.md)
- **Plan reference**: [docs/archive/v1/v1.17/plans/v1.17.0-adoption-ui-motion-identity.md](../../plans/v1.17.0-adoption-ui-motion-identity.md)

Context: Phases 1-5 landed the internal motion system (tokens, orbs, beam, metal, one-winner coordination). Phase 6 is the terminal gate: layout, gaps, CI, then `/update release`.

## 2. Chronological Steps

### 2.1 Architecture refactor

**Plan specification**: Empty/duplicate/orphan/overcomplicated structure across Phases 1-5; propose-then-apply via project-refactor and docs-layout-refactor; confirm `docs/archive/v1/v1.17/` is complete.

**What happened**: Detectors clean. No empty directories in `desktop/src/motion` or `desktop/src/components/agentState`. `check:docs-layout` and `check:naming` clean. No effect-library npm packages. `GenerationCanvas` already RETAINED. `ChatInput` gained a RETAINED-NOT-DEAD header (ChatPage mounts MediaComposer). ChatPage header comment now names MediaComposer. No file moves.

**Key files changed**: `ChatPage.tsx` (comment), `ChatInput.tsx` (header)

**Troubleshooting**: None.

**Verification**: empty-dir scan; docs-layout; naming.

---

### 2.2 Known-gaps reconciliation

**Plan specification**: Reconcile v1.16 carry-forward plus v1.17 items, including gigatoken N5. Finalize the per-minor file.

**What happened**: Carry-forward table points at `docs/archive/v1/v1.16/known-gaps.md` (serving/OCR items unchanged). Added DF-9 (gigatoken N5 watch) and DF-10 (ChatInput retained). DF-8 stays open (no on-device GPU trace this phase). Status stays in-progress until `/update release` (same as v1.16 Phase 6). Terminal reconciliation block written.

**Key files changed**: `docs/archive/v1/v1.17/known-gaps.md`

---

### 2.3 CI/CD

**Plan specification**: Cover motion foundation, orb/beam/metal, coordination; optimize path filters / concurrency / npm cache.

**What happened**: Audited `shell-build.yml` + `ci.yml`. Already covers `desktop/**` with concurrency cancel-in-progress, npm + cargo cache, PR ubuntu-only. Rejected narrowing to `desktop/src` (would skip tests and sidecar). Actions freeze ended 2026-08-01; does not apply. No workflow rewrite.

**Verification**: workflow read; no diff.

---

### 2.4 Testing and stabilization

**Plan specification**: Full desktop lint + typecheck + tests; update `docs/todos.md`; session history.

**What happened**: Comment-only product files. Suite re-run. todos.md prepended with a v1.17.0 complete block.

**Verification**: see section 3.

## 3. Verification Gate

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm run test:coverage --workspace @nexus/desktop` | PASS - 106 files / 916 passed / 0 failed |
| Line coverage | PASS - 92.92% lines / 86.2% branches / 85.08% functions |
| `npm run lint --workspace @nexus/desktop` | PASS |
| `npm run typecheck --workspace @nexus/desktop` | PASS |
| `npm run check:docs-layout` | PASS |
| `npm run check:naming` | PASS |
| Quality gate bypass | None |

---

## 4. Known Issues

| Issue | Severity | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| On-device GPU/battery not measured | P3 | DF-8; release QA |
| Tailwind `@theme` uncompiled | P3 | DF-1 |
| Installer motion separate | P3 | DF-3 |
| ASR / web-search unused | P3 | DF-5 |
| Chat pending is batch | P3 | DF-6 |
| gigatoken N5 watch | P3 | DF-9 |
| ChatInput not on ChatPage | P3 | DF-10; retain |

---

## 5. Plan Discrepancies

- Plan 6.3 suggested path filters scoped to `desktop/src`. Rejected: that would skip `desktop/tests` and `desktop/sidecar`. Kept `desktop/**`.
- Known-gaps Status is not flipped to finalized here; `/update release` owns that after the version bump (v1.16 precedent).
- Cursor cannot switch to the plan's strong/high model; session stayed on the current model (visible degrade, no downshift).
- No `# DEVIATION:` markers in code.

---

## 6. Assumptions Made

- Comment-only headers do not need new tests (ChatInput metal already covered in `sharedChat.test.tsx`).
- Two installers (PyQt + Tauri) with no new installer surface this cycle means installer-parity is a no-op, matching v1.16.
- platform-contract-verification and model-prompting-research self-gate because this is not a Nexus-Hub catalog repo.

---

## 7. Testing Summary

### Automated Tests
- Desktop Vitest: 916 passed, 0 failed (106 files)
- Coverage: 92.92% lines / 86.2% branches / 85.08% functions (thresholds 80 / 70 / 80)

### Manual Testing Still Needed
- [ ] On-device: one-motion-per-surface + reduced-motion + fps/battery (DF-8)
- [ ] `/update release` version bump, changelog, tag, push

---

## 8. TODO Tracker

### Completed This Session
- [x] 6.1 Layout audit; ChatInput retain; ChatPage comment
- [x] 6.2 Known-gaps reconcile (v1.16 table + DF-9 + DF-10)
- [x] 6.3 CI audit; no rewrite
- [x] 6.4 Tests, todos.md, session history

### Remaining
- [ ] `/update release` for v1.17.0

---

## 9. Summary and Next Steps

Phase 6 is the terminal close-out. Layout is clean. Seven deferred items remain, none blocking. CI already covers the motion surfaces. Release work is `/update release`.

**Next session should**:
1. Operator chooses commit / commit-and-push / amend / stop at 8.10.
2. Run `/update release` for the version bump, changelog, tag, and push.
3. On-device visual/GPU pass (DF-8) when a GPU is available.

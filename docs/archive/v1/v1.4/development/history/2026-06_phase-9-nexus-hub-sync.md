# Session history: v1.4.0 Phase 9 (FINAL) -- Nexus-Hub Sync + Whole-Plan Acceptance Gate

**Date**: 2026-06-09
**Cycle**: v1.4.0
**Phase**: 9 (FINAL -- Nexus-Hub sync + whole-plan acceptance gate)
**Plan reference**: [docs/versions/v1/v1.4.0/plans/adoption-claude-code-harness.md](../../plans/adoption-claude-code-harness.md)
**Acceptance scope**: integrate the parallel Nexus-Hub upgrade, close the 4 Nexus-Hub-dependent gaps, and verify the whole-plan definition of pass (all 12 adoptions; all ingested gaps resolved or re-justified; Nexus-Hub updates accounted for; full test matrix green at strong coverage).

## 1. Sub-tasks completed

| Sub-task | Output | Status |
|---|---|---|
| T032 (Nexus-Hub integration delta) | [development/nexus-hub-integration-delta.md](../nexus-hub-integration-delta.md): every Hub functionality (skills, commands, agents, hooks, rules, MCP configs, 6 extensions, data artifacts) with an integrated/not-integrated verdict + cited integration step. Nexus-AI integrates the skills catalog only; the rest is pulled-but-unused or routed to v1.5.0. | Closed |
| T033 (consumer wiring + Hub-dependent gaps) | `DEFAULT_UPSTREAM` `bendourthe/DevAI-Hub` -> `bendourthe/Nexus-Hub` in [core/skills/DevAIHubSyncer.ts](../../../../core/skills/DevAIHubSyncer.ts) (+2 regression tests in [tests/unit/core/skills/DevAIHubSyncer.test.ts](../../../../tests/unit/core/skills/DevAIHubSyncer.test.ts)); local `devai-hub` namespace preserved. `1.1.P2.A` + `1.1.P3.B` resolved; `T017.P3.E` + `T002.P2.A` re-justified Hub-owned. | Closed |
| T034 (whole-plan acceptance gate) | All four pass criteria green with fresh evidence (Section 5). Newly-surfaced `hono` prod advisory fixed in-phase via an `overrides` pin (4.12.25). | Closed |
| T035 (finalization) | [known-gaps.md](../../known-gaps.md) finalized (Status: finalized; 42 resolved this cycle); [RELEASE_NOTES.md](../../RELEASE_NOTES.md) written; desktop product version bumped 1.3.0 -> 1.4.0 (`desktop/package.json`, `tauri.conf.json`, `Cargo.toml`); [docs/todos.md](../../../../versions/todos.md) + [DEVLOG.md](../../../../versions/DEVLOG.md) updated; git tag prepared (not created). | Closed |

## 2. Decisions taken (the user said "continue"; safest defaults applied + stated)

- **Nexus-Hub = read-only.** The Hub is under active concurrent development (HEAD moved from `v3.0.0 Phase 2` dirty/conflicted to a clean `v3.2.0` with v3.0.0 / v3.1.0 / v3.1.1 tags cut *during* this phase's inspection). No commit, tag, conflict-resolution, or `make build-catalog` was performed in the Hub repo.
- **Offline.** The sync pipeline was verified against the local Hub clone via `buildManifest` (the gap `1.1.P3.B`'s own accepted faithful verification); no GitHub call was made.
- **Prepare-only release.** No git tag created, no semantic-release run. The in-repo desktop version bump was applied (consistent with the v1.3.0 precedent and the RELEASE_NOTES).

## 3. Deviations / scope decisions (no new correctness gaps)

| # | Deviation | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Plan Phase 2 (T006-T008) checkboxes were unticked in the plan markdown, suggesting incompleteness. | The known-gaps ledger (row T006-T008) confirms Phase 2 resolved 2026-05-30. All prior phases 1-8 are genuinely complete; the unticked boxes were stale. `is_final_phase = true` confirmed. |
| D2 | Plan T032 references the Hub at "latest version and latest release tag"; the Hub is a moving target (advanced under inspection). | The delta is explicitly a snapshot and treats the Hub as a versioned upstream consumed at a pinned release tag, never at HEAD. |
| D3 | Plan T033 instructs Hub-side actions (`make build-catalog`, cut a release tag, drain the allowlist, fix secret-scan FPs). | Under the read-only posture, the Hub-mutating actions were not performed. `1.1.P2.A`/`1.1.P3.B` are resolvable from the Nexus-AI side (the Hub's own cycle already did the catalog rebuild + tags); `T017.P3.E`/`T002.P2.A` are genuinely Hub-owned (their own text says "Track as a Nexus-Hub-side issue") and re-justified as open against the Hub repo. |
| D4 | Plan T033 wants the local `devai-hub` namespace consistent with the upstream rename. | Only the upstream GitHub coordinate was changed; the on-disk `devai-hub` namespace (root path, ACTIVE pointer, `source: "devai-hub"` provenance, IPC enum, audit flag) was preserved to avoid an on-disk-contract migration. Recorded as `HUB.P3.NS` for v1.5.0. |
| D5 | A newly-published `hono` moderate prod advisory broke `check:audit-prod` (not present at Phase 8; lockfile untouched -- pure upstream drift). | Fixed at root cause via an `overrides` pin to `^4.12.21` (resolves 4.12.25, a non-breaking patch within the current major), matching the existing `qs` override. The broad dev-only advisory set a blanket `npm audit fix` would touch was left out of scope (recorded as `T034.P2.A`). |

## 4. Open items added to known-gaps

- `T034.P2.A` (P2/WN) -- ~16 dev-only npm advisories (`ws`, `tmp`, `@inquirer/*`, `external-editor`); not production-gated; deferred to avoid broad dev-dep churn in a final-phase commit.
- `HUB.P3.*` (P3/DF, x7) -- net-new Nexus-Hub v3.x integration opportunities (commands, agents, hooks, rules, MCP configs, extensions, local namespace rename), routed to the v1.5.0 ecosystem cycle. Not part of the original 36-item carryforward; non-blocking.
- `T017.P3.E`, `T002.P2.A` remain open but re-justified as Hub-owned.

## 5. Verification evidence (acceptance gate)

- `npm run build` (`tsc -b`) -> clean.
- `npm run lint` (`eslint src modules`) -> clean.
- `npm run check-architecture` -> 0 errors / 10 pre-existing warnings.
- `node bin/nexus-check.mjs src/` (CI/husky-gated scope) -> 0 findings. (The whole-repo `npm run check` reports 25 pre-existing errors confined to `tests/`, `docs/archive/`, `scripts/hooks/`, `desktop/tests/` fixtures -- not the gated scope, none introduced this phase.)
- `npm run check:tampering` -> 0 findings.
- `npm run security:check` (SSOT drift) -> all safety surfaces in sync.
- `npm run check:audit-prod` -> 0 blocking (hono fixed to 4.12.25; 1 allowlisted `brace-expansion`).
- Full suite (`vitest run --coverage`) -> 339 files passed, 2 skipped (live-backend); 3903 tests passed, 5 skipped, 0 failed; line coverage 87.19%.
- Offline sync verification -> `buildManifest` over the local Nexus-Hub `catalog/skills` enumerates 251 skills including `hallmark-design` + `html-output-conventions`; `DEFAULT_UPSTREAM == "bendourthe/Nexus-Hub"`.

## 6. Definition of pass (whole-plan acceptance gate)

1. **All 12 adoptions A1-A12 implemented** -- yes (Phases 1-6; cross-checked in known-gaps summary).
2. **All ingested known gaps resolved or re-justified** -- 34 of 36 resolved; 2 (`T017.P3.E`, `T002.P2.A`) explicitly re-justified as Hub-owned.
3. **Nexus-Hub latest updates accounted for / integrated** -- the integration delta enumerates every Hub functionality; the one integrated surface (skills catalog) is unblocked by the upstream-coordinate fix.
4. **Updated testing across unit/static/integration/e2e/CI with strong coverage, all passing** -- yes (Section 5).

## 7. Next steps

- v1.4.0 is release-ready: review the staged commit, then create the prepared tag (`git tag -a v1.4.0`) if desired.
- v1.5.0 "Local Agent Maturity" cycle ingests the carryforward (`HUB.P3.*`, `T034.P2.A`, the P3/DF deferrals `T016.P3.A` / `T018.P3.A` / `T018.P3.B` / `T022.P3.A`) and the Hub-owned items via its `/generate-plan` Step 0.6.

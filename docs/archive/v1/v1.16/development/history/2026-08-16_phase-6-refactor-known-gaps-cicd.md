# Session History - v1.16.0 Phase 6 (FINAL): refactor + known-gaps + CI/CD + release readiness

**Date**: 2026-08-16
**Version**: v1.16.0
**Plan**: [../../plans/v1.16.0-adoption-local-serving-and-ocr.md](../../plans/v1.16.0-adoption-local-serving-and-ocr.md)
**Phase**: 6 of 6 (final) - Architecture Refactor, Known-Gaps Reconciliation, and CI/CD
**Outcome**: Complete. Release gate GO. Handed to `/update release`; nothing auto-tagged or pushed.

## Goal

Leave the project well-organized, its known gaps reconciled, and its CI/CD complete and optimized, then hand version bump / changelog / tag / push to `/update release`.

## Pre-flight

`is_final_phase` = **true** (all five signals): numerically last phase; title matches the v3.11.0 terminal gate; Phases 1-5 checklists and session histories exist; this is the only plan under `docs/archive/v1/v1.16/`. Prior phase committed as `605a0a7`.

Model routing: plan recommends strong reasoning / high. Re-score is frontier / max (repo-wide refactor, high blast radius). Cursor is picker-only; session stayed on the current model with no silent downshift.

## What was done (verification + reconciliation; no feature behaviour changed)

### 6.1 Architecture refactor

- **Detectors clean**: no empty directories in v1.16-touched trees (`desktop/sidecar/src/serving`, `core/documents`, `desktop/src/shared/models`). `check:docs-layout` and `check:naming` clean. `check-architecture` 0 errors / 10 pre-existing warnings (same baseline as v1.15).
- **Orphan triage -> retain, not delete**:
  - `parse_document` + `documentMemoryIngestor` + headless `documentParser` option -> LSO.P4.B/C (tested, unwired)
  - `createTelemetryMetricPublisher` -> LSO.P2.B (no bus subscriber)
  - `panelData` PLACEHOLDER_TRACE -> LSO.P2.A (per-request Trace list still fake; analytics above it are real)
  Each now carries a RETAINED-NOT-DEAD header.
- **Dual stacks kept**: vscode-bound `OllamaClient`/`LmStudioClient` vs headless twins, and `LocalAdapterRegistry` vs `serving/adapters.ts`, remain LSO.P1.B. Collapsing them needs injecting settings/logger into the bound clients first.
- **docs/archive/v1/v1.16/** complete: plan, comparison, known-gaps, guides, testing, docs-cleanup, session histories for Phases 1-6.
- No file moves. Propose-then-apply had nothing to apply.

### 6.2 Known-gaps reconciliation

- 19 open items across Phases 1-5 (0 NI, 15 DF, 4 MT), 0 new in Phase 6. All non-blocking.
- v1.15 carry-forward table added. IRSC.P4.B is the same all-zero HF pin that causes LSO.P3.A; one pin rotation closes both.
- Terminal reconciliation block written. Status stays in-progress until `/update release` bumps the version.

### 6.3 CI/CD

- Audited `ci.yml` + `shell-build.yml`. Every v1.16 surface is covered:
  - Serving gateway, OCR sidecar, Models UX, switcher: `shell-build.yml` (`desktop/**`, `core/**`, `modules/**`)
  - `parse_document`, MLX docs schema: unfiltered `ci.yml` `test-ts`
  - OCR + diffusion Python: `ci.yml` `test-python-runtimes` (pip cache; no GPU/weights)
- Optimization already in place: concurrency cancel-in-progress, npm/pip/cargo cache, PR-only ubuntu on shell-build, expensive OS matrix gated to push-to-main.
- **No change made**, deliberately: GitHub Actions has no per-job `paths:` filter. Splitting `test-python-runtimes` into its own path-filtered workflow would skip OCR tests on a cross-cutting PR. Same call as v1.15 not path-filtering `ci.yml`.

### 6.4 Testing and stabilization

| Suite | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Root vitest | 434 files / **4813 passed**, 6 skipped, **0 failed** |
| Desktop vitest | 95 files / **824 passed** |
| Python runtimes | **196 passed** |
| Build / types | `tsc -b` clean; desktop `tsc --noEmit` clean; `build:sidecar` clean |
| Lint | root eslint clean; desktop eslint `--max-warnings=0` clean |
| Architecture | `deps:check` 0 errors; `check-architecture` 0 errors / 10 pre-existing warnings |
| Docs layout / naming | both clean |
| Coverage | root 87.87% / 84.23% / 91.40%; desktop 92.50% / 85.56% / 84.57% (unchanged; comment-only headers) |

Notes: a golden-runner mock-live test timed out at 5s while root and desktop suites ran in parallel (ENV). Isolated re-run 3/3 in 2.3s; subsequent solo `npm test` 4813/0. Fixture timing noise discarded (`git checkout -- tests/fixtures`).

## Quality gates (Phase 7 GO/NO-GO)

| Gate | Threshold | Result |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Test failures | 0 | **0** after the ENV re-run |
| Coverage | >= 80% lines | **Yes** (Phase 5 numbers; no executable-line delta) |
| Lint errors | 0 | **0** |
| Build | succeeds | **Yes** |

**Verdict: GO.** No gate bypassed.

## Phase 8

1. `.gitignore`: **0 patterns added**
2. Test review: comment-only product files; headers do not need new tests. Re-ran root + desktop + Python.
3. CI/CD: verified, no rewrite (see 6.3).
4. Known-gaps: carry-forward + terminal block. Not version-finalized.
5. Docs cleanup: Phase 6 history added to the active tree; still all Cat 4; no moves.
6. DEVLOG prepend 2026-08-16 Phase 6.
7. No user-doc sync (no behaviour change).
8. This file.
9. Commit message generated; not committed until 8.10.
10. Prompt below.

## Release readiness (Phase 9)

- **9.0**: ran as 6.1-6.3 (refactor + gaps + CI). Cross-installer parity: this repo ships the PyQt installer plus the Tauri shell; no new installer surface in v1.16, so no new parity checker. Platform-contract verification: host discovery unchanged this cycle.
- **9A**: no release-blockers. Remaining items are on-device QA, composition-root wiring, or deliberate dual-stack design.
- **9B**: suites green; CI covers all changed surfaces.
- **9C-9E**: handed to `/update release`. **Nothing auto-tagged or pushed.**

## Files

**New**: this file.

**Modified**: `src/tools/handlers/parseDocument.ts`, `src/tools/handlers/documentMemoryIngestor.ts`, `core/observability/InferenceMetrics.ts`, `desktop/sidecar/src/coding/panelData.ts`, `modules/coding/runtime/headlessTools.ts` (RETAINED-NOT-DEAD headers only); `docs/archive/v1/v1.16/known-gaps.md`, `docs/DEVLOG.md`, `docs/archive/v1/v1.16/plans/v1.16.0-adoption-local-serving-and-ocr.md`, `docs/archive/v1/v1.16/docs-cleanup-report.md`, `docs/todos.md`.

## Next steps

1. Operator chooses commit / commit-and-push / amend / stop at 8.10.
2. Run `/update release` for the version bump, changelog, tag, and push.
3. On-device: gateway smoke (LSO.P1.C), OCR weights (LSO.P3.C), macOS MLX checklist (LSO.P5.A).

# Installing Nexus

v2.3.1 ships the full Nexus desktop application through a one-file provisioning installer on Windows. macOS and Linux receive only the optional platform-qualified VS Code extension in this release; standalone Tauri desktop bundles are withheld because they do not embed the pinned Node 22.11.0 runtime and runtime manifest required by the sidecar. The existing DF-1 tracks self-contained Node bundling for raw desktop packages, while DF-24 separately tracks the missing Unix selected-model snapshot write. Optional Video Lab enhancement uses a Video2X 6.4.0 executable you install yourself; the installer never downloads or bundles it.

The supported artifacts are attached to each [GitHub release](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/releases), alongside a `SHA256SUMS.txt` you can use to verify your download.

| Platform | Download | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Windows 10/11 (x64) | `NexusSetup.exe` | Complete desktop application, runtimes, models, and optional VSIX |
| Windows 10/11 (x64) | `nexus-coding-2.3.1-win32-x64.vsix` | Optional VS Code extension only |
| macOS 15+ (Apple Silicon) | `nexus-coding-2.3.1-darwin-arm64.vsix` | Optional VS Code extension only |
| Linux x86_64 (glibc 2.35+) | `nexus-coding-2.3.1-linux-x64.vsix` | Optional VS Code extension only |

The optional VS Code extension supports Microsoft stable VS Code 1.134 through 1.137 (all ship Electron 42, the same NODE_MODULE_VERSION as the bundled `better-sqlite3` 12.11.1 rebuild against the 42.8.1 pin). Earlier, later, Insiders, Cursor, and Windsurf hosts are not supported by this artifact. The Windows wizard shows a visible extension checkbox in Configuration Features, enables it for 1.134/1.135/1.136/1.137, and rechecks before installation. The Windows desktop application itself does not have this VS Code requirement.

The Windows installer embeds its target-qualified VSIX and matching desktop bundle. It downloads selected models and runtime components during installation, verifying downloaded payloads against pinned SHA-256 checksums. Expect 5-60 GB of downloads depending on the models you pick, so plan for disk space and a decent connection.

## Windows

1. Download `NexusSetup.exe` from the latest release.
2. Double-click it. It opens a single modern branded window (no generic pre-wizard dialog). **You will see a SmartScreen warning** ("Windows protected your PC") because the binary is not yet code-signed (signing is planned; see the note below). Click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.
3. The setup wizard walks you through hardware detection, install location, model selection (chat, coding, image, video), the compatible VS Code extension, and the embedded Nexus desktop app. Progress is shown per phase; every downloaded payload is checksum-verified.
4. When it finishes, the Nexus desktop app is installed and launched. To change your setup later (add models, reinstall components), just run `NexusSetup.exe` again.

Scripted / headless installs (`NexusSetup.exe` is the wizard itself -- there is no separate extract step):

```powershell
# Run the installer without a GUI, emitting a machine-parseable JSON summary:
NexusSetup.exe --headless --json-output
```

`NexusSetup.exe --help` lists the headless flags (`--model`, `--skip-model`, `--skip-extension`, `--skip-desktop`, `--install-path`).

## macOS

v2.3.1 does not publish a standalone macOS Nexus desktop package. The raw Tauri DMG was withheld because it does not contain the pinned Node runtime required by the sidecar, and the former universal name also overstated the single-architecture native module inside it.

If you use macOS 15+ on Apple Silicon and Microsoft stable VS Code 1.134 through 1.137, download `nexus-coding-2.3.1-darwin-arm64.vsix` and install it from VS Code's **Extensions: Install from VSIX...** command. Do not install it into Insiders, Cursor, Windsurf, an Intel host, an older macOS version, or another VS Code version.

## Linux

v2.3.1 does not publish a standalone Linux Nexus desktop package. The raw Tauri AppImage and deb were withheld because they do not contain the pinned Node runtime and runtime manifest required by the sidecar.

If you run Microsoft stable VS Code 1.134 through 1.137 on x86_64 Linux, download `nexus-coding-2.3.1-linux-x64.vsix` and install it from VS Code's **Extensions: Install from VSIX...** command. Do not install it into Insiders, Cursor, Windsurf, or another VS Code version. The native extension requires glibc 2.35+ (Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+, or another distribution with an equivalent/newer glibc); its release builder is pinned to Ubuntu 22.04 to keep that floor stable.

## Verifying your download

Each release attaches a `SHA256SUMS.txt` covering every asset:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS.txt
```

```powershell
# Windows
(Get-FileHash NexusSetup.exe -Algorithm SHA256).Hash
# compare against the NexusSetup.exe line in SHA256SUMS.txt
```

## What the Windows installer actually does

1. **Dependencies**: GPU runtime for your hardware (CUDA / ROCm / Metal, or CPU-only), Node runtime, Ollama, ffmpeg, and the diffusion Python environment.
2. **VS Code extension** (optional, offered when Microsoft stable VS Code 1.134 through 1.137 is present and still matches immediately before installation; replace uses `--force`).
3. **Models**: your selection from the typed catalog (Chat, Agentic Coding, Image, Video, Audio), downloaded with live progress; image/video weights come from Hugging Face, text models via Ollama.
4. **Nexus desktop app**: embedded in `NexusSetup.exe`, manifest/hash-checked, installed and health-checked, then launched from the finish page.

Optional Unsloth Core (local QLoRA fine-tuning runtime) is offered on Configuration Features, selected by default when the host is Compatible (NVIDIA 16 GB or more VRAM), and locked off when Incompatible. It is not a VS Code option.

Everything lands under your user account (no admin rights needed for the wizard itself); user data lives in `~/.nexus`.

## After you install (v2.3.1)

- **VS Code extension**: optional. The wizard enables the Features checkbox for Microsoft stable 1.134 through 1.137. 1.138+, Insiders, Cursor, and Windsurf stay visible and disabled. Replace uses `--force` only when `nexus-coding.nexus-coding` or `gemma-code.gemma-code` is already listed. After install, **Nexus Code: Select Agentic Model** (status bar and `/model`) lists only models from this install's `selected-models.json` that are agentic and present on disk, not every Ollama tag.
- **Desktop Chat, Agents, Image, and Video pickers**: the same this-install allowlist (`selected-models.json` ordered ids union Settings downloads). A missing snapshot shows only Get more models. Settings > Models remains the catalog browser, including cards you have not selected. On a 16 GB snapshot the Image default is `realvisxl-v5` when that id is owned. Juggernaut XL v9 is catalog id `juggernaut-xl-v9`; the wizard can auto-tick it because it is already on disk, which is not a ghost picker row.
- **Unsloth Core**: Configuration Features, on by default when Compatible (NVIDIA 16 GB+ VRAM). Not a VS Code option.
- **Embedder**: Nomic is required. EmbeddingGemma 300M is opt-in and does not reindex existing memory.

## After you install (v2.3.0)

- **Video Lab Enhance**: after a completed clip has a durable output id, Video Lab can offer Enhance. Install Video2X 6.4.0 yourself, then set `NEXUS_VIDEO2X_PATH` or Settings > Video > Video2X executable to the absolute executable path. Recheck capability; Enhance stays disabled until capability is ready. Clearing the setting and unsetting the env var turns the surface off. That does not uninstall Video2X and does not delete originals. Configuring a path does not install Video2X, search PATH, replace originals, grant network or Hub writes, or add Qwen3.8. Details: [video-enhancement-baseline.md](v2/v2.3/benchmarks/video-enhancement-baseline.md).

## After you install (v1.20.0)

- **Document attach**: Chat and Coding accept PDF, images, Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. Parsed text is shown locally; it does not auto-enter a prompt. First file only this cycle.
- **`parse_document`**: off until you set `nexus.coding.parseDocument.enabled` (VS Code) or `NEXUS_PARSE_DOCUMENT=1` / `~/.nexus/settings.json` (sidecar). CONFIRM still wraps the tool. Office files do not need RapidOCR or Unlimited-OCR.
- **No Docling**: layout-aware Docling was deferred (DF-5). Portable OCR requirements still exclude torch.

## After you install (v1.19.2)

- **Hermes 3**: `hermes3:8b` is an Agentic catalog pick (Ollama library). Enable `nexus.coding.harnessSelector.enabled` to apply `hermes-agentic` (llama3-json). The live coding loop still parses Gemma XML (DF-3). `hermes3:70b` is listed but is not a recommended default.
- **Inkling-Small**: hidden unless the patient tier is on (`nexus.llm.patientTier.enabled` or installer `NEXUS_PATIENT_TIER=1`). 74.8 GB GGUF, Apache-2.0, text-only at this quant (DF-2). Never auto-selected.
- **Weight variants**: models with `weights.variants` install one official line. Override with `NEXUS_WEIGHTS_VARIANT=<variant-id>`. Unofficial quants are rejected. sha256 still required.
- **Patient-tier copy**: warning floor is ~0.03 tok/s. `nexus.llm.patientTier.ramPreset` (`laptop` / `workstation` / `max`) is expectation copy; Nexus does not bundle the offload runtime.

## After you install (v1.19.1)

- **Security posture**: Settings > Security, or `"nexus.coding.securityPosture"`. Default `standard`. `unattended` skips CONFIRM-tier prompts only; `run_terminal` still confirms; hard-denied commands (`rm -rf`, `git push --force`, `DROP TABLE`) never run. This is not a no-floor mode.
- **LoopGuards**: auto-mode stops after five identical consecutive tool calls, an error burst, a bounded extra-call queue, or 60 iterations. Headless sidecar does not yet construct LoopGuards (DF-3).
- **watch_path / hash_file**: read-only workspace tools. Paths outside the project root are rejected.
- **Hub skills**: grounded-citation, persona-card, and avatar-prep prose live on Nexus-Hub branch `feat/v1.19.1-skill-native-wins`. Merge that branch, then `nexus skills sync --apply` (DF-2). Mapping: [skill-native-adoptions-v1.19.1.md](reference/skill-native-adoptions-v1.19.1.md).

## After you install (v1.19.0)

- **LFM2.5-2.6B**: on CPU and 8 GB agentic recommended lists as `lfm2.5:2.6b`. The installer pulls it through Ollama from `hf.co/LiquidAI/LFM2.5-2.6B-GGUF:Q4_K_M`. The card shows LFM Open License v1.0 (USD 10M commercial cap) as a use restriction, not a download gate.
- **8B-A1B is not in the catalog.** A quality-per-GB bake-off vs Qwen 14B and DeepSeek 16B was not completed; the row stays out until a dated local table shows a win.
- **Harness**: if you enable the existing `nexus.coding.harnessSelector.enabled` toggle, LFM uses the `lfm-agentic` profile. The live coding loop still parses Gemma XML (DF-6); listing the model does not by itself execute pythonic tool calls.

## After you install (v1.18.0)

- **llama.cpp on loopback**: Nexus does not bundle llama.cpp. If you already run `llama-server` on `127.0.0.1`, register it as `nexus.llm.localAdapters` and set `nexus.llm.backend` to the manifest name. Recipe: [llamacpp-loopback-adapter.md](reference/llamacpp-loopback-adapter.md). This does not enable the patient-tier catalog gate.
- **Skill-native mappings**: morning-brief *content* is the Hub `agent-presets` `morning-briefing` preset; browser GUI QA is Hub `browser-testing-with-devtools`. No new skill ships in this repo. See [skill-native-adoptions-v1.18.md](reference/skill-native-adoptions-v1.18.md).
- **Harness selector**: off by default. Enable `nexus.coding.harnessSelector.enabled` to apply a per-model scaffold overlay (prompt style, thinking mode, system-prompt budget). Inspect or switch with `/harness`. Named profiles are documented in [low-cost-model-optimization.md](reference/low-cost-model-optimization.md).
- **Catalog governance**: the desktop model picker badges models with in-repo `toolCallingVerified` provenance. MoE rows may list `activeParams` / `totalParams`; harness compute uses active params when present, residency never substitutes active for total. Unsloth UD / MXFP4-style labels are recognized as extreme-low-bit and stay blocked (`EXTREME_LOW_BIT_MIN_OLLAMA_VERSION` remains `999.0.0`).
- **MCP per-tool deny**: Settings > MCP lets you deny individual tools on allowed servers. Denies only tighten Hub policy; a toggle cannot enable a dropped server or a policy-denied tool. Persisted at `.nexus/mcp-tool-deny.json`.
- **Exec sandbox**: off by default (`nexus.coding.execSandbox`; sidecar `NEXUS_EXEC_SANDBOX=1`). When on, `run_terminal` is wrapped in Seatbelt (macOS), Landlock+seccomp (Linux, needs python3), or a Windows job object. Off or missing backend prints **unconfined**. Windows does not kernel-enforce filesystem or network.
- **ACP agent**: same Settings > Local API server section, separate toggle (`nexus.acp.enabled` or `NEXUS_ACP_ENABLED=1`). Uses the shared loopback listener and token at `POST /acp`. Off by default. Unattended CONFIRM/DANGEROUS calls park in Ask inbox.
- **Ask inbox and scheduler**: Admin > Ask inbox lists parked approvals. Approve replays the permission gate. The built-in morning-brief schedule is off until you enable it in that panel. There is no auto-approve path.

## After you install (v2.0.0)

- **Chat vision and voice**: image attach in Local Chatbot is on only for models whose catalog `modalities` include `image` (for example Gemma 4 12B IT GGUF). Audio files and the composer mic transcribe on-device after you install **faster-whisper-large-v3**. The Voice loop checkbox is off by default; turn it on for push-to-talk or VAD, and install **kokoro-82m** to hear replies. No image or audio bytes leave the machine.
- **Coding browser tools**: `browser_navigate` / `browser_click` / `browser_type` / `browser_aria_snapshot` / `browser_close` run in an isolated `~/.nexus/browser-profiles/` directory, never your logged-in Chrome. Every call is DANGEROUS and confirms. Install a local Chromium with `npx playwright@1.55.0 install chromium` if you want live pages; CI uses HTML fixtures only. See [browser-surface-security.md](v2/v2.0/browser-surface-security.md).
- **Video Lab continuation and avatar**: a requested duration longer than the tier clip chains segments in the timeline (prototype seams; not a measured Wan 2.2 quality claim). Talking-head (`audio2video`) is `diffusion-pro` only: install **longcat-video-avatar-1.5** (official Meituan INT8, sha256-pinned), tick the local-generation checkbox, and attach a photo plus audio. Those bytes stay on the device. Below-tier hosts do not see the control.

## After you install (v1.17.0)

The desktop shell now uses orbs, a surface-liveness beam, and a metal ring on Send / Generate / New session. If your OS has reduced-motion enabled, every effect **halts** (static fallbacks) instead of slowing down. Tokens: [design-tokens.md](v1/v1.17/design-tokens.md).

## After you install (v1.16.0)

- **Local API server**: off by default. In Nexus, open Settings > Local API server, turn it on, and copy the base URL plus token into Claude Code / Codex / Cursor. The server binds loopback only and serves model inference, never files or tools. See [README](../README.md#local-api-server-opt-in).
- **ACP agent** (v1.18.0): same Settings section, separate toggle. Uses the same loopback listener and token at `POST /acp`. Off by default. Unattended confirmations park in the ask inbox (or fail-closed if no inbox is configured).
- **Document parsing**: Settings > Models, install **RapidOCR PP-OCRv4** (CPU, every OS) and optionally **Unlimited-OCR 3B** (NVIDIA) for PDFs and images. Word, PowerPoint, and Excel (`.docx` / `.pptx` / `.xlsx`) parse with native libraries and do not require those OCR models or Docling. Attach in Local Chatbot or Agentic AI Coding. Parsed text is shown in the thread and is not auto-sent to a model. Neither OCR model is auto-installed.
- **MLX on Apple Silicon**: Nexus does not bundle MLX. Register an existing loopback server as described in [MLX via localAdapters](v1/v1.16/guides/mlx-via-local-adapters.md).

## Uninstalling

The installer itself does not register an uninstaller or a Start-menu entry -- it is a run-once setup tool, so once the Nexus desktop app is installed you can simply delete `NexusSetup.exe`. The product's own uninstaller ships with the desktop app.

- **Windows**: "Nexus" appears under Settings > Apps (installed by the desktop-app bundle); use it to remove the app. Delete `NexusSetup.exe` when you no longer need to re-run setup. `~/.nexus` (models, skills, settings) is preserved unless you remove it manually.
- **macOS**: drag the apps out of Applications; remove `~/.nexus` if you also want the data gone.
- **Linux**: delete the AppImage, `~/.local/bin/Nexus.AppImage`, the `~/.local/share/applications/nexus.desktop` entry, and optionally `~/.nexus`.

## A note on the security warnings

The Windows executable and the macOS app are **not yet code-signed or notarized** (the certificates are a recorded, deliberate deferral for this cycle), so SmartScreen and Gatekeeper flag them as from an unidentified developer. The mitigations are the checksum file above and the fact that every payload the installer fetches is SHA-256-pinned. If a future release ships signed binaries, these warnings disappear and this page will be updated.

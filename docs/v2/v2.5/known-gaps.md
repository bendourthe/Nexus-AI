# Known gaps carried forward

**Status**: in-progress
**Last updated**: 2026-09-23

Version directories through v2.4 moved to `docs/archive/`. The items below were not closed. They are not fixed. The archived files remain the detailed record.

| ID | Why it is still open | Archived record |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BG-2 | SANA ControlNet SHA-256 pins are still the all-zero placeholder. The files were not fetched. | `docs/archive/v2/v2.4/known-gaps.md` |
| DF-1 | MiniCPM tool tags are stripped by Ollama before Nexus can parse them. | `docs/archive/v2/v2.4/known-gaps.md` |
| WN-2 | The bundled MiniCPM template has no tools section. That template is outside this repo. | `docs/archive/v2/v2.4/known-gaps.md` |
| DF-v240-1 | Live NVIDIA splat generate was not run. | `docs/archive/v2/v2.4/known-gaps.md` |
| DF-v240-2 | TripoSplat weight file hashes were not downloaded. `source.sha256` is the all-zero placeholder. | `docs/archive/v2/v2.4/known-gaps.md` |
| DF-v240-3 | Older version gap logs still contain operator and hardware items that were not re-tested. | `docs/archive/v1/` and `docs/archive/v2/v2.0` through `v2.3` |
| MT-v240-1 | A real WebGL2 framebuffer was not captured. | `docs/archive/v2/v2.4/known-gaps.md` |
| QG-v240-1 | The full local suite was not run on the Electron `better-sqlite3` ABI. CI Node 22 ran it on the merge. | `docs/archive/v2/v2.4/known-gaps.md` |

v2.5 plans in this directory are not started by the v2.4.11 tag.

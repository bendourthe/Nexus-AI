Phases 1-5 implemented against five operator screenshots of the v2.4.7 desktop. Three were correctness defects (double-counted reasoning tokens, an installer snapshot that named an embedding model as the Chat pick and an untagged model as the Agentic pick, and a Settings tab order that had drifted from the installer); two were chrome and dismissal feedback. Every earlier open row carries forward. Publication and release wait on explicit approval.

### Resolved

- **BG-1 (resolved)** - Reasoning tokens double-counted: Ollama `eval_count` already includes thinking; the sidecar added a bytes/4 estimate on top. Phase 1 splits the provider total by text proportion. `desktop/tests/serving-chatCore.test.ts`.
- **BG-2 (resolved)** - Installer snapshot recommendation ignored catalog tier and mapped embeddings to Chat, so Agents defaulted to gpt-oss 20B. Phase 5 fixes `runtime_provisioner._recommended_by_task` and makes the desktop default catalog-endorsed. `scripts/installer/tests/test_runtime_provisioner.py`, `desktop/tests/selection-policy.test.ts`.
- **BG-3 (resolved)** - Settings tab order drifted from the installer (Document last). Phase 4 pins both sides to `tests/fixtures/v2.4.8-catalog-tab-order.json`.
- **BG-4 (resolved)** - Video generation failed with `module 'torch.nn' has no attribute 'RMSNorm'`: both media lock files pinned torch 2.3.0 while diffusers 0.36's SANA-Video needs 2.4+, and no readiness layer checked the version. Phase 8 pins 2.5.1 cu121 with verified wheels and adds a 2.4 floor to the installer smoke, the sidecar status, and the runtime readiness. `scripts/installer/tests/test_media_runtime_contract.py`, `desktop/tests/diffusion-runtime-factory.test.ts`, `tests/python/diffusion/test_real_execute.py`.

### Open Items

##### MT-1 - Packaged token label is not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 1 - Token split
- **Impact**: Tests pin the screenshot case (215 thinking bytes, 32 reply bytes, `eval_count: 72` -> 63 / 9) and the sum invariant. No packaged turn has been observed since.
- **Owner**: Operator, this cycle's installer rebuild
- **Next step**: Operator item 1 in `last-phase-evidence-v2.4.8-desktop-corrections.md`.

##### MT-2 - Packaged composer dismissal and Persona chrome are not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 2
- **Impact**: jsdom pointer and Escape events prove the hook; a real Tauri webview pointer has not.
- **Owner**: Operator, this cycle's installer rebuild
- **Next step**: Operator items 2-3.

##### MT-3 - Packaged Sessions title is not observed on all four pillars

- **Source phase**: Phase 3
- **Impact**: Tests pin copy and tokens on FolderTree and both studio panes; the packaged Agents pane title is asserted only through CodingPage copy.
- **Owner**: Operator, this cycle's installer rebuild
- **Next step**: Operator item 4.

##### MT-4 - Packaged Settings card is not compared against the packaged installer picker side by side

- **Source phase**: Phase 4
- **Impact**: Parity is asserted on values (tab order, colors, pill order) and on structure, not on rendered pixels. Font family differs by platform (Qt `FONT_PRIMARY` vs. the app's `--font-sans` stack) and is not asserted.
- **Owner**: Operator, this cycle's installer rebuild
- **Next step**: Operator item 5.

##### MT-5 - Packaged picker order and default are not observed after a fresh snapshot

- **Source phase**: Phase 5
- **Impact**: The desktop rule is proven against the stale on-disk snapshot; the installer's corrected writer is proven in pytest. The two have not been observed together on the operator host.
- **Owner**: Operator, this cycle's installer rebuild
- **Next step**: Operator items 6-7, then `type ~/.nexus/selected-models.json` to confirm `recommendedByTask.chat` and `.agentic` read `gemma-4-12b-it-gguf`.

##### MT-6 - Packaged Phase 7 card cluster and collapsible groups are not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 7 (added 2026-09-07)
- **Impact**: Tests pin size-then-action in the title row, the absence of star / checkmark / action row, the three headings with counts, collapse per tab, and disabled incompatible cards. None of it has rendered in the packaged desktop.
- **Owner**: Operator, this cycle's second installer rebuild
- **Next step**: Operator items 8-9 in `last-phase-evidence-v2.4.8-desktop-corrections.md`.

##### MT-7 - Packaged Phase 8 surfaces are not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 8 (added 2026-09-07)
- **Impact**: Tests pin the torch floor on three layers, the `loading` / `generating` stages, the `Loading model...` bubble state, the centered composer cluster, and the footer copy. No packaged install has yet reprovisioned the venv to torch 2.5.1 or generated a video on it.
- **Owner**: Operator, this cycle's third installer rebuild
- **Next step**: Operator items 10-15 in `last-phase-evidence-v2.4.8-desktop-corrections.md`.

##### DF-5 - The stale torch 2.3.0 venv is repaired only by a reinstall or a Settings > Video Repair

- **Source phase**: Phase 8
- **Impact**: The desktop now reports the stale venv as repairable and offers Repair; the runtime refuses to generate with a typed message. Nothing upgrades the venv automatically. The wheel download is about 2.4 GB on Windows.
- **Owner**: Operator
- **Next step**: Re-run the rebuilt installer (the changed manifest fingerprint reprovisions) or press Repair in Settings > Video.

##### DF-4 - Settings no longer offers a way to set or clear a favorite model

- **Source phase**: Phase 7
- **Impact**: The star was the only Settings control for a favorite. Pickers still write a favorite on every model change and `resolveDefaultId` still honors it, so a favorite once set cannot be cleared from the UI.
- **Owner**: Next desktop cycle
- **Next step**: Decide whether favorites are dropped entirely (remove `writeFavorite` from the pickers) or get a small control on the picker itself.

##### DF-1 - The inferred reasoning / output split is not flagged in the tooltip

- **Source phase**: Phase 1
- **Impact**: When the provider gives only a total, the split is proportional and estimated while the total is exact. No protocol field carries "split inferred", so the tooltip states both numbers plainly.
- **Owner**: Next desktop cycle
- **Next step**: Add an optional `reasoningSplit: "provider" | "inferred"` to the `done` event and render `~` on inferred parts.

##### DF-2 - Uncommitted installer wizard-merge state rides in the rebuilt installer

- **Source phase**: Phase 6
- **Impact**: `develop` carries 30 modified and 6 untracked files (installer wizard merge rounds 1-3, recorded only in `docs/todos.md`). This plan neither staged nor reverted them; the rebuilt `NexusSetup.exe` includes them, as did the installer the operator already field-tested.
- **Owner**: Operator
- **Next step**: Decide whether the wizard merge becomes its own plan and commit, or is discarded, before v2.4.8 publishes.

##### DF-3 - Stale `recommendedByTask` on already-installed hosts is only masked, not rewritten

- **Source phase**: Phase 5
- **Impact**: The desktop rule keeps pickers and defaults correct against the stale snapshot; the file itself still says `chat: embeddinggemma` until the installer runs again. Settings downloads append to it without correcting it.
- **Owner**: Next desktop cycle
- **Next step**: Have the sidecar's `loadOrMigrate` drop a `recommendedByTask` entry whose model is not on the task's tab.

## v2.4.7

### Summary

Phases 1-5 implemented against four operator screenshots of the v2.4.6 installer. One was a defect this project introduced in v2.4.5; three were density and scope feedback. Every earlier open row carries forward, because the v2.4.7 rebuild is the first installer since v2.4.6 merged.

### Open Items

##### MT-1 - The reworked wizard is not observed in the packaged window

- **Source phase**: Phases 1-4
- **Impact**: Tests pin selection-scoped sizing across four consumers, the derived component resolver, the overlaid Browse button, the column-scoped Ollama URL, the hidden VS Code paragraph, one-line storage in the facts column, and the counter row. None of it has rendered in the packaged wizard, and Qt geometry does not resolve headlessly.
- **Owner**: Operator, this cycle's installer rebuild
- **Next step**: Operator items 1-5 in `last-phase-evidence-v2.4.7-wizard-density.md`.

##### DF-1 - An already-installed Ollama still reads as "will be installed"

- **Source phase**: Phase 2 - Configuration scope
- **Impact**: `state.ollama_installed` could mark the row satisfied rather than pending. The installer step is already idempotent, so this is imprecise wording rather than wrong behavior.
- **Owner**: Next installer cycle
- **Next step**: Render a distinct "already present" state for a satisfied required component.

##### DF-2 - Category labels are not coloured chips

- **Source phase**: Phase 4 - Review density and model summary
- **Impact**: Screenshot 4's mockup colours each category label. The counter row delivers the visual separation the operator asked for; recolouring the labels is cosmetic and carries a palette decision with no correctness content.
- **Owner**: Next installer cycle
- **Next step**: Decide a per-category palette, or accept the current neutral headings.

### Resolved

##### BG-1 - Review reported two contradictory sizes for one selection (resolved)

- **Resolved**: 2026-09-06 in Phases 1 and 4.
- **Evidence**: The card claimed `7 selected (7 already downloaded, 0 to download)` beside `~157 GB to download / 233.2 GB already downloaded`. The counts were computed per id and correct; the sizes were read from `installed_report.pending_gb` / `downloaded_gb`, which are catalog-wide because the picker probes every entry so each card can show a Downloaded pill. `pending_download_gb` returned the same catalog-wide value, so the install guard demanded headroom for models the user never selected, and `can_select_model` credited back the catalog-wide downloaded total. Introduced in v2.4.5; its tests missed it because every fixture made the report cover exactly the selection, so the two scopes coincided. `state.pending_models_gb` is now the single selection-scoped figure, written beside `selected_models_gb` and read by all four consumers. `test_selection_scoped_sizing.py` adds 13 cases in which every fixture uses a catalog strictly wider than the selection, and both pre-existing fixture helpers were rebuilt with that property. Packaged confirmation remains MT-1.

## v2.4.6

Phase 7 of field-delivery is implemented locally. Chat, Agents, Image, and Video pickers fail closed on the this-install allowlist, recommend order, Stop, studio captions without Shaping, Advanced on the context row, RealVis default when owned, and GPU busy while a scheduler job is active. Packaged four-tab chrome is not yet observed. Every earlier v2.4.5 / v2.4.4 open item carries forward.

### Open Items

##### MT-1 - Packaged payload fingerprint and maximized first show are not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 1 - Packaged delivery and installer window
- **Impact**: Tests pin stale-bundle refusal, Settings fingerprint copy, and `present_installer_window` calling `showMaximized`. None of it has run in a frozen NexusSetup.exe on the operator host.
- **Owner**: Operator, this cycle's installer rebuild
- **Next step**: Phase 8 human items (1) and (5).

##### MT-2 - Packaged Setup compactness is not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 2 - Installer Setup compactness
- **Plan reference**: `docs/v2/v2.4/plans/v2.4.6-field-delivery-density-and-session-identity.md` (sub-tasks 2.1-2.3)
- **Reason**: Qt tests pin two-column prereqs, a title-row Re-check icon, one-line GPU text, worker replacement, elision, and no trailing stretch. None of it has run in a frozen NexusSetup.exe on the operator host.
- **Suggested next step**: Phase 8 human item for Setup screenshot 1.

##### MT-3 - Packaged Configuration, Review groups, and VS Code 1.136 VSIX load are not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 3 - Configuration, VS Code host, and Review groups
- **Plan reference**: `docs/v2/v2.4/plans/v2.4.6-field-delivery-density-and-session-identity.md` (sub-tasks 3.1-3.4)
- **Reason**: Tests pin Unsloth default-on when Compatible, 1.136 enabled and checked, absent Gemma/Video2X copy, and Review headings that keep juggernaut-xl-v9 under Image. None of it has run in a frozen NexusSetup.exe, and the VSIX has not been loaded in Microsoft VS Code 1.136.0 on the operator host.
- **Suggested next step**: Phase 8 human items for screenshots 2-4 and a `code --install-extension` on 1.136.

##### MT-4 - Packaged VS Code owned-agentic picker is not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 4 - VS Code Agentic Model Surface
- **Plan reference**: `docs/v2/v2.4/plans/v2.4.6-field-delivery-density-and-session-identity.md` (sub-tasks 4.1-4.4)
- **Reason**: Unit tests pin the AD-13 allowlist, empty-snapshot fail-closed, leftover installed ids absent, default `gemma-4-12b-it-gguf` when owned, and tool dispatch plus ConfirmationGate after a model switch. The command, status bar, and `/model` have not been clicked in a VSIX loaded on Microsoft VS Code 1.136.0.
- **Suggested next step**: Phase 8 human item: install the rebuilt VSIX, open Select Agentic Model, confirm leftover Ollama tags are absent.

##### MT-5 - Packaged Sessions History chrome is not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 5 - Sessions History chrome and Session nouns
- **Plan reference**: `docs/v2/v2.4/plans/v2.4.6-field-delivery-density-and-session-identity.md` (sub-tasks 5.1-5.4)
- **Reason**: Desktop tests pin the empty header, left-aligned create actions, `HISTORY_HAIRLINE_GAP` on both sides of the rule, Session copy, and the unchanged Chatbot tab label. None of it has run in a frozen desktop from this cycle's installer on the operator host.
- **Suggested next step**: Phase 8 human item (6): empty and filled Sessions History, centered hairline, Session copy, Chatbot tab unchanged.

##### MT-6 - Packaged Settings compact cards are not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 6 - Settings model cards
- **Plan reference**: `docs/v2/v2.4/plans/v2.4.6-field-delivery-density-and-session-identity.md` (sub-tasks 6.1-6.2)
- **Reason**: Desktop tests fail if Details, Best for, Why this one, `Also agentic`, `Backend model:`, or `ID:` return, and they pin the Gemma 4 12B three-line card plus a centered action row. None of it has run in a frozen desktop from this cycle's installer on the operator host.
- **Suggested next step**: Phase 8 human item (7): Settings Gemma card matches the three-line spec, no Details.

##### MT-7 - Packaged four-tab runtime chrome is not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 7 - Four-tab runtime chrome
- **Plan reference**: `docs/v2/v2.4/plans/v2.4.6-field-delivery-density-and-session-identity.md` (sub-tasks 7.1-7.4)
- **Reason**: Desktop vitest pins leftover exclusion on Chat/Agents/Image/Video, Gemma 4 12B before LFM and gpt-oss among owned ids, RealVis default when owned, Stop replacing Send while streaming, Creating/Generating labels (orb state remains shaping), Advanced in `composer-advanced-slot`, and GPU not Idle at 0% while a job is active. None of it has run in a frozen desktop from this cycle's installer on the operator host.
- **Suggested next step**: Phase 8 human items for Chat tokens/Stop, Agents recommend order, Image RealVis plus captions, Video Generating, leftover absence, and GPU busy during a live turn.

##### WN-1 - Mtime freshness cannot catch a freshly copied stale NSIS

- **Source phase**: Phase 1 - Packaged delivery and installer window
- **Impact**: Staging compares desktop source mtimes to the bundle mtime. Last week's tauri output left in `desktop/src-tauri/target` fails as intended. An old NSIS copied onto disk *after* source last changed gets a new timestamp and can still freeze.
- **Owner**: Phase 8 if field evidence shows a copied stale payload
- **Next step**: Prefer `cd desktop; npm run build:shell` immediately before `build-windows.ps1`. A source-tree stamp from `build:shell` would close the hole.

##### WN-2 - Electron ABI for VS Code 1.136 is inferred from 1.134/1.135

- **Source phase**: Phase 3 - Configuration, VS Code host, and Review groups
- **Plan reference**: `docs/v2/v2.4/plans/v2.4.6-field-delivery-density-and-session-identity.md` (sub-task 3.2)
- **Reason**: vscode-versions listed 1.134.0 and 1.135.0 at Electron 42.8.1. 1.136.0 released 2026-09-02 and was not in that table at planning time. This phase kept the rebuild pin at 42.8.1 rather than claiming a new ABI.
- **Suggested next step**: Confirm `process.versions.electron` on the operator 1.136.0 host before Phase 8 VSIX rebuild; if it is not 42.8.1, rebuild `better-sqlite3` for that Electron.

## v2.4.5

Phases 1-5 implemented against an operator screenshot of the v2.4.4 installer rebuild: the Review step refused to proceed with `Insufficient disk space (need 204.4 GB free, have 201.0 GB)` on a host already holding 176 GB of the selected models. Measuring the store first established there were no duplicate downloads, which relocated the defect from the downloader to the precheck. Every v2.4.4 open item carries forward unchanged, because this cycle's installer rebuild is the first opportunity to observe any of them.

### Open Items

##### MT-1 - Packaged installer behavior is not observed

- **Source phase**: Phases 2-4
- **Impact**: Tests pin the probe across both stores and every failure mode, the Downloaded pill, first-load auto-selection that defers to user edits, two-column Review with per-model marks, a pending-only estimate, and the guard passing the exact field reproduction while still blocking a 500 GB new selection. None of it has run in the packaged wizard.
- **Owner**: Operator, this cycle's installer rebuild
- **Next step**: Operator items 1-4 in `last-phase-evidence-v2.4.5-installer-downloaded.md`.

##### MT-2 - Ollama API detection path is not exercised against a live daemon

- **Source phase**: Phase 1 - Downloaded-model probe
- **Impact**: The `/api/tags` branch is covered by an injected fake and the disk-manifest fallback by real fixture files. A live Ollama returning its real payload shape has not been probed. A response shape change would silently fall back to the manifest path, which is correct but slower and would log a `probe_errors` line.
- **Owner**: Operator, next packaged run
- **Next step**: Operator item 4 (chat models detected with Ollama running, and again with it stopped).

##### WN-1 - Two pre-existing ruff F401 findings remain

- **Source phase**: Carried from v2.4.4 WN-1; unchanged by this cycle
- **Impact**: `runtimes/diffusion/vram_lifecycle.py:35` and `tests/python/diffusion/test_registry.py:6`. Neither file is touched by this plan.
- **Owner**: Next cleanup pass
- **Next step**: Both are auto-fixable; left alone because they trace to no line in this plan.

### Resolved

##### BG-1 - Installer refused an install for models already on disk (resolved)

- **Resolved**: 2026-09-01 in Phases 1-4.
- **Evidence**: The guard was handed `selected_models_gb`, a catalog-size sum with no filesystem reference. Measured host state showed 11 distinct model directories, each present once, empty `_tmp`, and `inkling-small` legitimately ~74.7 GB as a three-part GGUF split - so nothing had been downloaded twice and the downloader (`_install_file`, which skips verified files) was never at fault. `pending_download_gb` now sizes the remaining download for the guard, the picker footer, and `can_select_model` alike. `test_field_case_passes_the_guard` asserts 194.4 GB selected / 176.4 GB present / 201.0 GB free now passes, `test_the_same_selection_was_refused_before_the_fix` pins the old `204.4 GB` message, and `test_a_genuinely_oversized_new_selection_still_blocks` proves the guard was fixed rather than disabled. Packaged observation remains MT-1.

Phases 1-7 are implemented locally against packaged post-v2.4.3 screenshots 1-6. Every change is proven by automated tests; none of the six field symptoms has been re-observed on the packaged 16 GB NVIDIA host, because that requires a rebuilt installer this cycle did not produce. The Diffusers pin moved 0.34.0 to 0.36.0 on distribution evidence, and a live import plus a Wan and SDXL re-smoke on the new pin are the highest-value operator items.

### Open Items

##### MT-1 - Packaged transcript gutters and pill glow are not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 1 - Transcript Gutters and Thinking Pill
- **Impact**: The gutter is proven as one `paddingInline` on the list with no downstream inset, and list, row, and pending are all overflow-visible. jsdom does not lay out a packaged transcript, so whether the glow is uncropped at 100% and 150% zoom is not observed here.
- **Owner**: Operator, next packaged build
- **Next step**: Operator item 1. Supersedes v2.4.3 MT-3, which stated the same limit against the 12px inset this phase deleted.

##### MT-2 - Packaged hairline centering and title inset are not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 2 - History Hairline, Title Inset, and Bulk Actions
- **Impact**: Tests pin one symmetric `marginBlock` on the rule, zero padding-top on the tree header, and a chat title as the first node after the selection rail. Pixel spacing in a packaged window is not observed here. Archive All and Delete All are proven against an in-memory client, including chats inside collapsed folders, but not against the real IPC store.
- **Owner**: Operator, next packaged build
- **Next step**: Operator item 2. Supersedes v2.4.3 MT-2.

##### MT-3 - Packaged NVIDIA restyle identity is not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 3 - Image Restyle Identity on the GPU
- **Impact**: Four contributors are fixed and each is pinned by a test: the parser accepts trailing punctuation, the send always resolves to img2img with the identity prompt or fails closed, strength 0 survives, the seed is forwarded, and a pipeline that echoes its source raises `unchanged-output`. Whether a real SANA/SDXL img2img at strength 0.85 produces black fur on this host is not observed here.
- **Owner**: Operator, next packaged build
- **Next step**: Operator item 3. Supersedes v2.4.3 MT-6; this is the third cycle to carry it.

##### MT-4 - Live SANA import on the 0.36.0 pin is not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 4 - SANA Family Diffusers Pin
- **Impact**: 0.36.0 was verified from published wheels to contain the SANA video pipeline modules and to export both class names, and to declare no torch or transformers upper bound. `from diffusers import SanaPipeline, SanaVideoPipeline` has not been executed in a provisioned venv, because Diffusers resolves pipelines lazily and the probe needs the full media runtime.
- **Owner**: Operator, next packaged build
- **Next step**: Operator item 4. Supersedes v2.4.3 MT-7.

##### DF-1 - Wan and SDXL are not re-smoked on the new Diffusers pin

- **Source phase**: Phase 4 - SANA Family Diffusers Pin
- **Impact**: The pin change touches every Image and Video model on the host, not only SANA. Nothing in the automated suites exercises a real pipeline load, so a regression in Wan or SDXL under 0.36.0 would not be caught locally.
- **Owner**: Operator, next packaged build
- **Next step**: Operator item 4, second half. This is the highest-blast-radius unobserved change in the cycle.

##### MT-5 - Packaged generation liveness is not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 5 - Generation Liveness and Studio Captions
- **Impact**: The reader is proven to answer `health` while a job is inside its handler, heartbeats are proven to emit and stop, and a pending studio orb is proven unpaused. Whether the packaged freeze is fully explained by the blocked reader, or partly by GPU compositor starvation on a 16 GB laptop, is not established. No headroom value was changed, deliberately, because there is no evidence for choosing one.
- **Owner**: Operator, next packaged build
- **Next step**: Operator item 5. If the window still stalls with the reader unblocked, compositor VRAM is the remaining hypothesis and `workingMemReserveGB` becomes the next lever.

##### MT-6 - Packaged Settings density is not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 6 - Settings Models Density and Details
- **Impact**: Tests pin search inside the tab row container, a centered horizontal action row, no card min-height, split pill label/value colours, and Best for as bullets. Real-viewport card height and wrap behaviour at the packaged Settings width are not observed here.
- **Owner**: Operator, next packaged build
- **Next step**: Operator item 6. Supersedes v2.4.3 MT-4.

##### QG-1 - Develop-targeted pull requests now run the full merge-result gate (resolved)

- **Resolved**: 2026-08-31 in Phase 7, with explicit operator approval.
- **Evidence**: Carried from v2.4.3 QG-5. Every substantive workflow filtered `pull_request` to `main`, so PR 58 (which targets `develop`) ran only commitlint: the push trigger tested the branch head, but the merge result was never tested. `develop` was added to the `pull_request.branches` filter of `ci.yml`, `shell-build.yml`, `installer-tests.yml`, `coverage-diff.yml`, and `pr-quality.yml`; no job logic changed. Confirmed by observation, not assertion: `gh pr checks 58` now reports 42 pass, 1 skipping (path-gated `init.ps1`), 0 fail on head `4b1771da`, against a pull request that previously ran one check.

##### WN-1 - Two pre-existing ruff F401 findings remain

- **Source phase**: Phase 3 - Image Restyle Identity on the GPU (observed, not caused)
- **Impact**: `runtimes/diffusion/vram_lifecycle.py:35` imports `typing.Any` unused and `tests/python/diffusion/test_registry.py:6` imports `sys` unused. Neither file was touched by this cycle, and every file that was touched passes ruff.
- **Owner**: Next cleanup pass
- **Next step**: Both are auto-fixable. Left alone here because they trace to no line in this plan.

Phases 1-7 are implemented locally. A packaged wizard screenshot of the two-column Configuration/Review pages and Unsloth lock on this 16 GB NVIDIA host is not observed here. Hairline pixels and dialog centering in a packaged window are not observed here. Thinking-pill glow containment in a packaged transcript is not proven in jsdom. Packaged Settings nowrap facts and icon colors are not observed here. Packaged Agents picker order on this 16 GB install is not observed here. Packaged NVIDIA restyle before/after is not observed here. A packaged NVIDIA SANA-Video clip (or a live missing-file string from that install) is not observed here.

### Open Items

##### MT-1 - Packaged installer two-column layout and Unsloth lock are not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 1 - Installer Two-Column Layout and Unsloth Lock
- **Plan reference**: [v2.4.3-field-density-identity-and-runtime.md](plans/v2.4.3-field-density-identity-and-runtime.md) T001 / 1.1
- **Reason**: Pytest proves two-column widgets, Unsloth disabled when Incompatible, Compatible after NVIDIA 16384 on showEvent, Review 16 GB, and the renamed time label. A packaged wizard run on this host is not recorded here.
- **Suggested next step**: Last-phase operator item (Configuration two columns and Unsloth Compatible on this 16 GB NVIDIA host).

##### MT-2 - Hairline pixels and delete-dialog centering are not proven in jsdom

- **Source phase**: Phase 2 - History Chrome, Selection, Titles, and Delete Overlay
- **Plan reference**: [v2.4.3-field-density-identity-and-runtime.md](plans/v2.4.3-field-density-identity-and-runtime.md) T007 / 2.1
- **Reason**: Tests assert the hairline node on `/images` (absent on Settings), New chat `onSelect`/`onOpenChat`, a pre-created Image title change, and `folder-tree-confirm-delete` as a child of `document.body`. jsdom does not layout a packaged window so the hairline's appearance and the dialog's visual center are not observed here.
- **Suggested next step**: Last-phase operator items (hairline under tabs; New chat selects empty; Image first prompt titles the row; delete dialog centered).

##### MT-3 - Thinking-pill glow pixel containment is not proven in jsdom

- **Source phase**: Phase 3 - Thinking Pill Geometry
- **Plan reference**: [v2.4.3-field-density-identity-and-runtime.md](plans/v2.4.3-field-density-identity-and-runtime.md) T013 / 3.1
- **Reason**: Tests pin min-width to `Searching...`, a 12 px left inset, and overflow visible on the pill host and chat pending row. jsdom does not layout a packaged transcript, so glow pixels vs the pane edge are not observed here. v2.4.2 MT-1 remains the prior-cycle statement of the same limit.
- **Suggested next step**: Last-phase operator item (thinking pill glow at 100% and 150% zoom).

##### MT-4 - Packaged Settings compact-card nowrap and icon colors are not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 4 - Settings Models Compact Cards
- **Plan reference**: [v2.4.3-field-density-identity-and-runtime.md](plans/v2.4.3-field-density-identity-and-runtime.md) T016 / 4.1
- **Reason**: Tests pin a nowrap facts row without Company/License pills, pills inside Details, and green / red / blue action colors via inline style. A packaged Settings screenshot is not recorded here.
- **Suggested next step**: Last-phase operator item (Settings one facts line and icon colors).

##### MT-5 - Packaged Agents picker order and empty-session default are not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 5 - Shared Picker Rank and Default
- **Plan reference**: [v2.4.3-field-density-identity-and-runtime.md](plans/v2.4.3-field-density-identity-and-runtime.md) T020 / 5.1
- **Reason**: Tests prove `resolveDefaultId` prefers `gemma-4-12b-it-gguf` over a gpt-oss favorite, and QuickModelSwitcher lists Gemma before gpt-oss at 16 GB with recommendOrder. A packaged Agents screenshot on this host is not recorded here.
- **Suggested next step**: Last-phase operator item (Agents empty session defaults to Gemma 4 12B on this install).

##### MT-6 - Packaged NVIDIA restyle identity is not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 6 - Image Restyle Identity
- **Plan reference**: [v2.4.3-field-density-identity-and-runtime.md](plans/v2.4.3-field-density-identity-and-runtime.md) T024 / 6.1
- **Reason**: Tests prove restyle strength 0.7, identity prompt, no SAM2, and fail-closed without last output. A packaged NVIDIA before/after of "Make the puppy black" is not recorded here. v2.4.2 MT-3 remains the prior-cycle statement of the same limit.
- **Suggested next step**: Last-phase operator item (Make the puppy black restyles fur).

##### MT-7 - Packaged NVIDIA SANA-Video clip is not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 7 - SANA-Video Layout and Executor
- **Plan reference**: [v2.4.3-field-density-identity-and-runtime.md](plans/v2.4.3-field-density-identity-and-runtime.md) T028 / 7.1
- **Reason**: Tests prove a complete SANA fixture loads SanaVideoPipeline with local_files_only and never WanPipeline, an incomplete tree names the missing path, catalog files include model_index.json plus scheduler/tokenizer/VAE, and 16 GB default video stays wan2.1-t2v-1.3b. A packaged NVIDIA generate of sana-video-2b-720p is not recorded here.
- **Suggested next step**: Last-phase operator item (opt-in SANA-Video either plays a clip or names a real missing file).

## v2.4.2

Phases 1-7 are implemented locally. Phase 7 recorded last-phase evidence and is waiting on T043 push/PR approval against `develop` ([PR 58](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/pull/58)). jsdom cannot prove thinking-pill pixel containment, a live overflow pane jumping to the latest turn, or two Settings cards filling a real viewport. Packaged img2img identity, empty-video fail-closed, and a live installer GPU/Unsloth/VS Code screenshot are not observed here. Operator items 1-9 remain Not observed (`not_observed != absent`).

### Open Items

##### MT-1 - Thinking-pill pixel containment is not proven in jsdom layout

- **Source phase**: Phase 1 - Sidebar History Host and Shared Chrome
- **Plan reference**: [v2.4.2-field-ui-history-and-generation.md](plans/v2.4.2-field-ui-history-and-generation.md) T005 / 1.5
- **Reason**: jsdom does not layout. The Phase 1 test asserts overflow visible, sibling pill chrome (so `border-radius: 999px` is not on the canvas host), and `rectFullyInside` with mocked boxes. A real `getBoundingClientRect()` crop cannot be observed here.
- **Suggested next step**: Phase 7 operator item 1 (thinking pill at 100% and 150% zoom) is the layout proof.

##### MT-2 - Composer stick-to-bottom is proven on a mocked scroller, not a live pane

- **Source phase**: Phase 2 - Transcript Honesty
- **Plan reference**: [v2.4.2-field-ui-history-and-generation.md](plans/v2.4.2-field-ui-history-and-generation.md) T009 / 2.1
- **Reason**: `useStickToBottom` tests assign `scrollHeight` / `clientHeight` and assert `stickNow` sets `scrollTop`. They do not layout Chat, Agents, Image, or Video overflow panes with real content height after send.
- **Suggested next step**: Phase 7 operator send on each of the four tabs and confirm the new user turn is in view unless the user scrolled up.

##### MT-3 - Packaged img2img identity for "Make that puppy black" is not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 3 - Image Follow-up Identity
- **Plan reference**: [v2.4.2-field-ui-history-and-generation.md](plans/v2.4.2-field-ui-history-and-generation.md) T016 / 3.1
- **Reason**: Automated tests prove img2img against last PNG bytes, strength 0.45, and no SAM2 for that phrase. A packaged NVIDIA run that the same puppy is recolored rather than resampled is not recorded here.
- **Suggested next step**: Phase 7 operator item: generate a puppy, send "Make that puppy black" with no attachment, capture before/after.

##### MT-4 - Packaged empty-video fail-closed is not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 4 - Video Fail-Closed Output
- **Plan reference**: [v2.4.2-field-ui-history-and-generation.md](plans/v2.4.2-field-ui-history-and-generation.md) T020 / 4.1
- **Reason**: Automated tests prove persist of the playable-clip error, Settings > Models on missing weights, and fail-closed when `resolveMp4Url` is empty. A packaged NVIDIA run that a first puppy-in-grass turn never paints an empty success bubble is not recorded here.
- **Suggested next step**: Phase 7 operator item: send a Video Lab prompt that cannot produce a clip (missing weights or empty path) and capture the written failure.

##### MT-5 - Settings Models density is not proven on a real viewport

- **Source phase**: Phase 5 - Settings Models Density
- **Plan reference**: [v2.4.2-field-ui-history-and-generation.md](plans/v2.4.2-field-ui-history-and-generation.md) T024 / 5.1
- **Reason**: Tests assert the catalog fingerprint is absent, chrome gap is `--space-1`, and card padding is `--space-2`. jsdom does not layout two downloaded cards against a packaged window height.
- **Suggested next step**: Phase 7 operator item 8 (Settings Models density).

##### MT-6 - Live installer VRAM / Unsloth / VS Code merge is not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 6 - Installer VRAM, Unsloth, and VS Code Merge
- **Plan reference**: [v2.4.2-field-ui-history-and-generation.md](plans/v2.4.2-field-ui-history-and-generation.md) T028 / 6.1
- **Reason**: Pytest pins 16384 and 15360 display as 16 GB, Unsloth Compatible/Incompatible before opt-in, and a 7-step route with the VS Code checkbox on Configuration. A packaged wizard run on this NVIDIA host is not recorded here.
- **Suggested next step**: Phase 7 operator item 9 (installer GPU line shows whole GB and Unsloth badge on the same page as VS Code).

Phases 1-6 of the generation-recovery plan are committed locally. Phase 7 proved packaged NVIDIA image and video generation on this host (exact installer SHA-256 `E29725ADE5671271962CE9FB6DE66DCAA38BA182DC257802DFA835C78120490D`). Remaining operator checklist items (clean-install visuals, gated Hugging Face account, reboot persistence, Settings/Data/Training, transcript/Agents screenshots) stay Not observed. Publication still requires the full local gate, one Phase 7 commit, and explicit push/PR approval. `not_observed != absent` throughout.

### Open Items

##### DF-1 - Packaged Windows clean and repair installer behavior is not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 1 and Phase 8 human testing
- **Plan reference**: Phase 8.7 operator items 1-3
- **Reason**: The prior packaged field run exposed imperceptible fixed-value motion, low percentage contrast, and hidden finalization work that left the bar at 73% while visible groups said Done. The replacement implements and tests a repeating liquid gradient, contrast capsule, and complete visible step mapping, and its frozen smoke passes. A clean/repair visual run of the replacement is not observed.
- **Owner / next evidence**: Release operator. Run checklist items 1-3 on a clean Windows Sandbox and an existing Nexus install, then attach screenshots and `nexus-install-nexus-desktop-log.txt`.

##### DF-3 - Reasoning disclosure is not observed with a thinking-capable local model

- **Source phase**: Phase 3 and Phase 8 human testing
- **Plan reference**: Phase 8.7 operator item 6
- **Reason**: Component and hydration tests prove collapsed-by-default disclosure, keyboard access, absence when no reasoning exists, and token tooltip detail. No local provider turn with separate reasoning content was run here.
- **Owner / next evidence**: Desktop operator. Use a catalog model that emits separate reasoning, confirm the disclosure expands without moving reasoning into the answer bubble, and capture collapsed and expanded states.

##### DF-4 - Archive, delete, reset, and restore are not observed across all four pillars

- **Source phase**: Phase 4 and Phase 8 human testing
- **Plan reference**: Phase 8.7 operator item 7
- **Reason**: Store, IPC, cancellation, late-event, and page-reset tests cover Chatbot, Agents, Images, and Videos. A packaged four-pillar operator matrix was not run.
- **Owner / next evidence**: Desktop operator. Complete checklist item 7 and record one session id per pillar plus the reset and restore result.

##### DF-5 - Installer/Settings visual parity and live disk-meter change are not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 5 and Phase 8 human testing
- **Plan reference**: Phase 8.7 operator item 8
- **Reason**: The prior packaged field run exposed Nomic as incorrectly required and incompatible rows above compatible rows. The replacement makes EmbeddingGemma 300M the required/default app-wide embedder and compatibility the first ordering partition in installer and Settings. Automated shared-policy tests pass; replacement visual parity and an observed free-space change after model install/remove are not recorded.
- **Owner / next evidence**: Release operator. Capture the same model in both surfaces, then install/remove it and record the disk meter before and after.

##### DF-6 - Native folder pickers outside Windows are not observed

- **Source phase**: Phase 7
- **Plan reference**: Phase 8.7 operator item 9
- **Reason**: The Tauri command and frontend cancellation/stale-result behavior are automated. macOS and Linux picker behavior was not run on native hosts.
- **Owner / next evidence**: Platform operator. On macOS and Linux, select, cancel, and rapidly reopen the picker and record the resulting workspace chips.

##### DF-7 - Windows multi-root OS sandbox confinement remains partial

- **Source phase**: Phase 6 and Phase 8 human testing
- **Plan reference**: Phase 8.7 operator item 9
- **Reason**: Canonical path guards and scoped tool tests allow both selected roots and deny outside paths. The Windows sandbox backend still does not kernel-enforce filesystem or network confinement, so the support tier remains partial even when the UI and path guard behave correctly.
- **Owner / next evidence**: Security owner. Keep the existing loud partial/unconfined status. A later sandbox phase must add kernel-enforced Windows filesystem and network boundaries before claiming confined support.

##### QG-2 - Indexed skill catalog paths remain absent from this checkout

- **Source phase**: Phase 8 architecture, known-gaps, docs layout, and CI reconciliation; generation-recovery Phase 7
- **Plan reference**: Phase 8.1-8.5 and generation-recovery T089-T093
- **Reason**: The plan-indexed `catalog/skills/...` paths and the repository `.agents/skills` bundle still do not contain `project-refactor`, `docs-layout-refactor`, `known-gaps-tracker`, `cicd-architect`, `verification-before-completion`, or `dev-progress-tracker`. This Phase 7 session loaded the user-level copies under `C:\Users\bdour\.agents\skills` and followed those procedures. The repo-local mapping is still missing.
- **Suggested next step**: Vendor or map the canonical skill files into the repository catalog before the next planning session, or update plan templates to the user-level install path.

##### QG-5 - Develop-targeted pull requests miss several merge-result workflows

- **Source phase**: Generation-recovery Phase 7 terminal CI comparison
- **Plan reference**: T093
- **Reason**: `ci.yml`, `installer-tests.yml`, `shell-build.yml`, `pr-quality.yml`, `coverage-diff.yml`, and `codeql.yml` limit `pull_request.branches` to `main`. Feature-branch `push` still runs `ci.yml` and path-gated installer tests, and `commitlint.yml` runs on any PR. There is no always-resolving aggregate required-check job, and `package.json` has no `fast` / `full` / `platform` / `report` / `release` profile scripts. Workflow files were not changed; silence is not approval.
- **Suggested next step**: After explicit approval, add `develop` to the listed `pull_request.branches` (or an aggregate gate job) in the smallest set of workflows that must validate the merge result. Record any remaining profile-script differences as environment-only.

##### QG-6 - Model-prompting freshness helper is absent

- **Source phase**: Generation-recovery Phase 7 advisory governance check
- **Plan reference**: implement-phase 9.0 duty 8
- **Reason**: `python scripts/check_model_prompting_freshness.py --advisory` cannot run because the file is absent. The duty is advisory and does not block the phase.
- **Suggested next step**: Add the helper in a later tooling change, or keep the logged no-op.

### Resolved Items

##### DF-2 - Real NVIDIA CUDA diffusion generation is now observed

- **Resolved**: 2026-08-30 in generation-recovery Phase 7.
- **Evidence**: Packaged `runtime.json` schema 3 reports `diffusion.status=ready`, `torch 2.3.0+cu121`, `cuda_available=true` on an RTX 3080 Ti Laptop (driver 596.08). Exact unsigned installer SHA-256 `E29725ADE5671271962CE9FB6DE66DCAA38BA182DC257802DFA835C78120490D` plus installed sidecar produced a 512x512 PNG (330437 bytes, SHA-256 `1db719ce7693e918e958e22f6b7de34fe9bede4b5e9b128bdad4fc96db35fa80`, sampled variance 4034.6219) and an H.264 MP4 (848x480, 13 frames, 1.083 s, SHA-256 `60bb5cb281b7845ec7839467ba4d3ababd3a15cea52dd43e4cdfbb54a9a22422`) via `scripts/installer/build/smoke-installed-media.ps1`. Reboot persistence is still Not observed.

##### WN-1 - Rust format drift resolved

- **Resolved**: 2026-08-29 in Phase 8.
- **Evidence**: Applied canonical `cargo fmt --all` output to `desktop/src-tauri/src/lib.rs` and `sidecar.rs`. Fresh `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, Clippy with warnings denied, and all 19 Rust tests pass.

##### WN-2 - Installer-wide Ruff drift resolved

- **Resolved**: 2026-08-29 in Phase 8.
- **Evidence**: Applied Ruff's safe fixes, repaired the remaining line-length and style findings, and formatted the complete installer tree. Fresh `uv run ruff check .` reports `All checks passed!`; `uv run ruff format --check .` reports 171 files formatted.

##### QG-4 - Repository-wide nexus-check baseline enforced

- **Resolved**: 2026-08-29 in Phase 8.
- **Evidence**: Removed the two insecure-random production/test calls and added `configs/nexus-check-baseline.json` plus CLI enforcement that consumes only exact rule/file/message counts, fails excess findings, fails stale entries, and rejects malformed baselines. Fresh `npm run check --silent` reports 0 errors, 53 warnings, 56 exact matches, and 0 stale entries; focused CLI/memory/workspace tests pass.

##### QG-1 - Release-preconditions helper is absent

- **Resolved**: 2026-08-30 in generation-recovery Phase 7.
- **Evidence**: `python scripts/check_release_preconditions.py --branches --repo-settings` now reports the current branch, dirty tree, origin, and GitHub repository settings without mutation. Focused tests in `tests/python/test_release_helpers.py` pass.

##### QG-3 - Unicode-safety helper is absent

- **Resolved**: 2026-08-30 in generation-recovery Phase 7.
- **Evidence**: `python scripts/validate_unicode_safety.py --strict` now rejects BOMs and unsafe punctuation and can fix them. The same focused helper tests pass, and the Phase 7 text additions scanned with 21 files / 0 failures.

### Reconciliation of Earlier Active Files (v2.4.4, 2026-08-31)

Glob of 31 `docs/**/known-gaps.md` files. Files whose Status is `in-progress`, or whose Open Items remain, were each read against this cycle's observations:

- `docs/v2/v2.4/known-gaps.md` (this file): v2.4.3 MT-2, MT-3, MT-4, MT-6, and MT-7 are each superseded by a v2.4.4 row that states the same unobserved limit against the new code. None is closed: this cycle produced no packaged observation, and the plan forbids closing them because a fix exists. v2.4.3 MT-1 (installer two-column, Unsloth lock) and MT-5 (picker order) are carried forward untouched - this screenshot set does not cover them.
- `docs/v2/v2.3/known-gaps.md`: still in-progress. Nothing observed here bears on MT-1 or the v2.3.0 DF/QG rows. Unchanged.
- `docs/v2/v2.0/known-gaps.md`: still in-progress with hardware and audio deferrals. No observation this cycle. Unchanged.
- `docs/v1/v1.20/known-gaps.md`, `docs/v1/v1.19/known-gaps.md`: still in-progress. No v2.4.4 observation closes their DF rows. Unchanged.
- `docs/v1/v1.3/known-gaps.md`, `docs/v1/v1.5/known-gaps.md`, `docs/v1/v1.8/known-gaps.md`: open or rehearsal-blocked historical carryforward. Unchanged.
- `docs/v2/v2.1`, `docs/v2/v2.2`, and the remaining `docs/v1/**` and `docs/archive/**` ledgers: finalized. Left in place; no historical GPU or visual row was closed without new observation.

### Reconciliation of Earlier Active Files

- `docs/v2/v2.3/known-gaps.md`: reviewed 2026-08-30; still in-progress. v2.4.1 generation recovery does not close MT-1 or the v2.3.0 DF/QG rows. They remain unchanged.
- `docs/v2/v2.2/known-gaps.md`: finalized; packaged GPU evidence is still absent, so historical rows remain unchanged.
- `docs/v2/v2.1/known-gaps.md`: finalized; no change.
- `docs/v2/v2.0/known-gaps.md`: reviewed 2026-08-30; still in-progress with DF-1 and other hardware/audio deferrals. This cycle produced no observed evidence for those rows.
- `docs/v1/v1.20/known-gaps.md` and `docs/v1/v1.19/known-gaps.md`: still in-progress. No v2.4.1 observation closes their remaining DF rows.
- `docs/v1/v1.8/known-gaps.md` and `docs/v1/v1.5/known-gaps.md`: still in-progress or rehearsal-blocked; not modified.
- `docs/v1/v1.3/known-gaps.md`: Status remains open for historical skill-cleaner carryforward; not modified.
- Glob of 31 `docs/**/known-gaps.md` files: archive and finalized ledgers were left in place. No historical GPU/visual row was closed without new observation.

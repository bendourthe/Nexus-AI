# [2.4.11](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/compare/v2.4.1...v2.4.11) (2026-09-23)

This tag covers develop since `v2.4.1`, including the 2.4.2-2.4.10 field work that had no separate tag, and the local Gaussian splat viewer that landed in pull request 68.

### Features

* **Splat viewer:** orbit a local `.splat` or `.ply` in Image Studio with an internal WebGL2 canvas, a still-frame fallback, and no remote fetch.
* **Honesty copy:** the 3D preview says unseen sides are invented and are not a measured property tour. The source PNG stays downloadable.
* **Optional generate:** a child job on the existing queue fails closed without NVIDIA CUDA. The TripoSplat adapter spawns Python with the shell off only when local weights are already present. The catalog row is not pre-ticked and has no file hash.

Activation: Viewer needs no switch. Generate needs `NEXUS_SPLAT_NVIDIA=1` and `NEXUS_SPLAT_CUDA=1`, plus `diffusion_models/triposplat_fp16.safetensors` and `infer.py` under `~/.nexus/models/triposplat/`. The installer does not download those files.
Validation: `node scripts/bench-gaussian-splat.mjs` prints `"validation":"pass"` for the fake row. `--real` prints `not proven here`.
Rollback: Unset `NEXUS_SPLAT_NVIDIA` and `NEXUS_SPLAT_CUDA`, and delete `~/.nexus/models/triposplat/`. That does not remove 2D image models or the source PNG.
Authority: The env vars do not download weights, do not call a splat service, do not replace the source PNG, and do not enable generate on macOS or a non-NVIDIA host.
Docs: [docs/archive/v2/v2.4/benchmarks/gaussian-splat-baseline.md](docs/archive/v2/v2.4/benchmarks/gaussian-splat-baseline.md)

### Bug Fixes

* **Video enhancement paths:** treat Windows 8.3 and macOS `/var` tmpdir aliases as the same identity as `realpath` when the leaf is a regular file, so Shell Build Windows/macOS vitest can pass the same suite as Ubuntu. Do not retag `v2.3.1`.
* **Windows process host:** pin the PowerShell helper PATH to System32 and .NET Framework roots so in-memory `Add-Type` can find `csc.exe`, and run desktop vitest as a single worker on Windows CI so those compiles are not starved by parallel coverage. Do not retag `v2.3.1`.

Plan: [v2.4.0 splat](docs/archive/v2/v2.4/plans/v2.4.0-adoption-unsloth-qwen38-gaussian-splatting.md). Gaps that remain open: [carried forward](docs/v2/v2.5/known-gaps.md).

# Unreleased

# [2.4.1](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/compare/v2.3.1...v2.4.1) (2026-08-29)

Windows installer and field-reliability candidate. Automated and packaged-smoke evidence is local-first; the operator checklist keeps clean/repair install visuals, live CUDA generation, and packaged interaction checks explicit until observed.

### Features

* **Transcript and archives:** separate pending motion from response bubbles, add compact accessible token metadata and provider-supplied reasoning disclosure, and support archive/restore/delete with active-view reset across Chatbot, Agents, Images, and Videos.
* **Models and workspaces:** share model ordering and display facts between installer and Settings, add a live model-storage meter, and support durable multi-root Agents workspaces with union-of-roots authorization and workspace-grouped history.

### Bug Fixes

* **Installer completion:** make overall progress prominent and monotonic, bundle frozen Unsloth pins, and contain optional provisioning failures without misreporting successful required work.
* **Image runtime readiness:** provision and repair the pinned diffusion environment, fail closed when CUDA readiness is not observed, and retain the last known-good runtime on repair failure.
* **Release gates:** format the inherited Rust and installer Python baselines and add an exact-count, stale-detecting repository-check baseline for intentional historical fixtures while leaving new or excess errors blocking.

# [2.3.1](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/compare/v2.3.0...v2.3.1) (2026-08-29)

Windows installer field repair after v2.3.0. Local-only. Packaged wizard screenshots remain human QA, not a silent pass. `host_detect.py` OS-specific probes stay at 40% line coverage (MT-1). Marketplace `engines.vscode` `^1.134.0` also matches 1.136+ at VS Code engine-check time; the wizard still disables 1.136+.

Activation: Optional VS Code extension: tick the wizard checkbox when Microsoft stable `code` 1.134 or 1.135 is on PATH. Unsloth Core: enable Configuration > Unsloth Core (off by default; NVIDIA 16 GB+ VRAM). EmbeddingGemma 300M: select it on Models; it is not required.
Validation: VS Code: `code --version` is 1.134.x or 1.135.0 and the checkbox is enabled; after install, `code --list-extensions` includes `nexus-coding.nexus-coding`. Unsloth: the toggle is on Configuration, not the VS Code page. Embedder: Nomic stays Required; EmbeddingGemma copy says 300M.
Rollback: Untick the VS Code checkbox or uninstall the extension. Turn Unsloth off on Configuration. Leave EmbeddingGemma unselected; Nomic remains the required embedder. None of these uninstall VS Code, CUDA, or existing models.
Authority: The VS Code checkbox does not install VS Code, does not enable 1.136+, and does not change the desktop app. Unsloth does not grant network training or Hub writes. Selecting EmbeddingGemma does not reindex existing memory.
Docs: [docs/install.md](docs/install.md), [docs/archive/v2/v2.3/development/vscode-host-policy.md](docs/archive/v2/v2.3/development/vscode-host-policy.md), [docs/archive/v2/v2.3/development/embedder-default-decision.md](docs/archive/v2/v2.3/development/embedder-default-decision.md).

The packaged desktop application remains Windows-only; raw Tauri bundles stay withheld (DF-38).


### Features

* **VS Code 1.135:** offer the optional extension on Microsoft stable 1.134 and 1.135 (same Electron 42.8.1 ABI), always show the checkbox, and replace with `--force` when Nexus or legacy Gemma Code is already installed ([3e59fa5](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/3e59fa5))
* **Unsloth placement:** explain Unsloth Core on Configuration Features, off by default, not on the VS Code page ([3e59fa5](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/3e59fa5))
* **Honest RAM:** catalog badges use host `total_ram_gb` instead of install-path free disk ([3d35228](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/3d35228))


### Bug Fixes

* **Install thread:** keep the windowed wizard alive when the install QThread throws, marshal model telemetry onto the GUI thread, and fail in-window with a redacted log ([ce85fe3](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/ce85fe3))
* **Catalog chrome:** paint name rows and installing lists on card surfaces instead of window-color bars ([a0413bb](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/a0413bb))
* **Embedder copy:** keep `nomic-embed-text` required and lock EmbeddingGemma user-facing copy to 300M, not 300B ([7137827](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/7137827))
* **Packaging:** encode `engines.vscode` as `^1.134.0` so vsce 2.24.0 can package; the wizard still disables 1.136+ ([f53a5f7](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/f53a5f7))


### Documentation

* **v2.3.1:** record last-phase evidence, VS Code host policy, embedder KEEP decision, and the integration merge ([9260c5d](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/9260c5d), [838268f](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/838268f))
* **v2.3.0 follow-up:** record the first full-matrix Shell Build Windows/macOS desktop vitest miss after tag `v2.3.0` (BG-1) ([67f3640](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/67f3640))

# [2.3.0](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/compare/v2.2.9...v2.3.0) (2026-08-29)

Optional local video enhancement after v2.2.9. Local-only. Real Video2X 6.4.0, GPU/VRAM, packaged detection, and perceptual review remain not proven here (DF-3). Hydrated Enhance remains unrestored (DF-1). The Nexus-Hub security-audit workflow is still unreleased (DF-2).

Activation: Install Video2X 6.4.0 yourself, then set `NEXUS_VIDEO2X_PATH` or Settings > Video > Video2X executable to the absolute executable path.
Validation: In Video Lab, Recheck capability; Enhance is enabled only when capability is ready. Contract check: `node scripts/bench-video-enhancement.mjs --backend fake`.
Rollback: Clear Settings > Video > Video2X executable and unset `NEXUS_VIDEO2X_PATH`. That does not uninstall Video2X. Original clips remain.
Authority: Configuring a path does not install or download Video2X, does not search PATH, does not replace originals, does not grant network or Hub writes, and does not add Qwen3.8.
Docs: [docs/archive/v2/v2.3/benchmarks/video-enhancement-baseline.md](docs/archive/v2/v2.3/benchmarks/video-enhancement-baseline.md)

The optional VS Code extension still requires VS Code 1.134.0 exactly. The packaged desktop application remains Windows-only; raw Tauri bundles stay withheld (DF-38).


### Features

* **Enhancement contract:** add a backend-neutral local enhancement contract, keep Qwen3.8 out of catalogs, and hand OpenWorker security refinements to Nexus-Hub without editing the sibling repository ([0e4b41b](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/0e4b41b))
* **Guarded core:** add a Video2X 6.4.0 adapter behind process isolation that never downloads or bundles the executable ([7d94f93](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/7d94f93))
* **Durable jobs:** persist `video_enhancement` child jobs with separate provenance and original-file preservation ([40174cd](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/40174cd))
* **Video Lab Enhance:** offer capability-backed presets, progress, cancellation, and distinct original versus enhanced downloads ([6989f16](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/6989f16))
* **Support copy:** share setup, env, setting, and capability strings from `core/video/video-enhancement-support.json` ([5f48246](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/5f48246))
* **Settings path:** store an absolute `video.video2xPath`, prefer `NEXUS_VIDEO2X_PATH`, and prove fake-backend fixture geometry without bundling Video2X ([5f48246](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/5f48246))


### Bug Fixes

* **Linux CI:** use host-absolute tmpdir fixtures so POSIX `path.isAbsolute` does not reject Windows drive-letter test paths ([e7e4368](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/e7e4368))
* **Packaging:** withhold raw Tauri bundles that do not embed Node 22.11.0 (DF-38), keep the optional extension on exact VS Code 1.134.0, and exclude Video2X binaries, AGPL source, and automatic-download URLs from the tree


### Documentation

* **v2.3.0:** record last-phase evidence, known gaps, and the integration merge ([a0a0115](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/a0a0115), [52d72d1](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/52d72d1))
* **Forward plans:** add the v2.3.1 installer field-repair plan and the v2.4.0 Unsloth Qwen / Gaussian Splatting comparison on `develop` ([39c5007](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/39c5007), [3bea05e](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/3bea05e))

# [2.2.9](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/compare/v2.2.8...v2.2.9) (2026-08-28)

Field chrome, catalog identity, and honest generation after v2.2.8. Local-only. Packaged Windows visual behavior remains not proven here (DF-36), and live GPU image/video generation remains not proven here (DF-4).

This release changes no opt-in capability or installer flag. The packaged desktop application is Windows-only in v2.2.9; macOS and Linux receive the optional platform VSIX but no raw Tauri desktop package. The optional extension requires VS Code 1.134.0 exactly because its bundled `better-sqlite3` 12.11.1 native module targets that host's Electron 42.8.1 runtime; other VS Code versions are not supported by this release artifact.


### Features

* **Chat chrome:** clean up the composer, split Context from the model picker, move full-word time/token meta above bubbles, select the active row, and persist the first generated title ([b7d519c](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/b7d519c))
* **Thinking state:** rotate reduced-motion-safe Thinking, Searching, Working, and Solving captions while a local reply is composing ([6949a02](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/6949a02))
* **Studio identity:** align Image and Video history copy and selection with Chatbot, and meter studio sessions against their visual-token budgets ([fcb22f1](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/fcb22f1))
* **Generate honesty:** distinguish CUDA, weights, and GPU readiness failures instead of collapsing them into one fallback string ([9995a80](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/9995a80), [ecf818d](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/ecf818d))
* **Catalog identity:** put Embeddings first, share the installer/Settings name-row pill grammar including Inkling-Small, and sort downloaded Settings models first ([c29b21e](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/c29b21e))
* **Hub sync:** normalize leading `v` tags, report staged sync progress honestly, and explain quarantine while the injection scanner stays enabled ([fb5b5bb](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/fb5b5bb))


### Bug Fixes

* **Diffusion safety:** restrict stub images to pytest so an environment flag alone cannot enable fake output on a real host ([ecf818d](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/ecf818d))
* **Packaging:** build OS/architecture-qualified VSIX files through the canonical fail-closed Electron native-module pipeline, upgrade `better-sqlite3` to 12.11.1 for Electron 42.8.1 compatibility, pin the extension and Windows wizard to exact Microsoft stable VS Code 1.134.0, publish the complete Windows provisioning installer, withhold raw Tauri bundles that do not embed Node 22.11.0, and exclude local session state, harness files, test caches, logs, and build-only configuration from the artifact


### Documentation

* **v2.2.9:** record the implementation plan, phase evidence, preserved known gaps, and unsigned installer smoke proof ([71dc6e8](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/71dc6e8), [ecf818d](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/ecf818d), [9f155e5](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/9f155e5))

# [2.2.8](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/compare/v2.2.5...v2.2.8) (2026-08-24)

Working local studio after the v2.2.5 cut (plans v2.2.6 through v2.2.8, one tag). Local-only. Packaged Chatbot `Hi`, live GPU generate, and packaged Hub Active=latest remain unproven (DF-32, DF-4, DF-35). Packaged Explorer launch is observed (DF-2 closed). The installer desktop pin stays `v2.1.0` until this tag's bundle assets attach.

This release changes no opt-in capability, installer flag, or host surface.


### Features

* **v2.2.7:** show catalog context windows as `<val>k` chips and persist per-turn token usage ([8cf5a56](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/8cf5a56), [a71f531](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/a71f531))
* **v2.2.7:** add the composer Context meter, 80% new-session CTA, and transcript date/time/token chrome ([d2893a0](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/d2893a0), [946658b](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/946658b))
* **v2.2.8:** keep local chat and generate RPCs open past 15s and treat Ollama `gemma4:12b` as Downloaded ([f672d6d](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/f672d6d))
* **v2.2.8:** share FolderTree history chrome across Chatbot, Agents, Images, and Videos ([f47bc5e](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/f47bc5e))
* **v2.2.8:** inset the module rail and center composing orbs ([d4c3a42](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/d4c3a42))
* **v2.2.8:** match Settings Models sort to the installer catalog ([3b557c0](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/3b557c0))
* **v2.2.8:** apply Hub latest with per-skill quarantine while the injection scanner stays on ([692d068](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/692d068))


### Bug Fixes

* **v2.2.8:** remove leftover Agents SessionListPanel now that FolderTree owns history ([86dff64](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/86dff64))


### Documentation

* **v2.2.6:** reconcile session-memory layout, known-gaps, and CI ([6fab8d9](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/6fab8d9))

# [2.2.5](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/compare/v2.1.0...v2.2.5) (2026-08-23)

Field-repair cycle after the v2.1.0 cut (plans v2.2.0 through v2.2.5, one tag). Local-only. Packaged Explorer soak and live GPU generate remain unproven (DF-2, DF-4). The installer desktop pin stays `v2.1.0` until this tag's bundle assets attach.

This release changes no opt-in capability, installer flag, or host surface.


### Features

* **v2.2:** repair sidecar packaging so the Node backend can start, and show every installed model honestly ([bd63e52](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/bd63e52), [972ccd0](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/972ccd0), [6362a90](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/6362a90))

### Bug Fixes

* **v2.1.0:** close code-completeable known-gaps without claiming live GPU passes ([04900fe](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/04900fe))


### Documentation

* **v2.1.0:** reconcile known-gaps and document CI hardware gates ([d22cc48](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/d22cc48))

Open local-AI wave. Local-only after weight download. `localEval.status` is `not_run`; `recommended.json` is unchanged. Plan: [v2.1.0](docs/archive/v2/v2.1/plans/v2.1.0-adoption-open-local-ai-wave.md).


### Opt-in surfaces

#### Local fine-tuning (Settings > Fine-tuning)

- Activation: Settings > Fine-tuning, then Provision. Default is off (`opt_in=False`; not on the installer `chain_for`). Live GPU train also needs `NEXUS_TUNING_LIVE=1`.
- Validation: after provision, Settings shows provision status ready (or unsupported with a reason). A stub job (`--stub`) completes without a GPU. `NEXUS_TUNING_LIVE=1` is required for a real Unsloth train.
- Rollback: do not provision. If already provisioned, leave the venv unused; jobs are cancelled from the Fine-tuning tab. Unsloth Studio/CLI extras are never installed.
- Authority: this does not add training to the default installer, does not import GGUF into Ollama unless you opt in, does not skip `redactSecrets` on datasets, and does not make zoo AGPL (zoo is LGPL).
- Docs: [README](README.md#whats-new-in-v210), [docs/archive/v2/v2.1/development/unsloth-license-boundary.md](docs/archive/v2/v2.1/development/unsloth-license-boundary.md), [docs/archive/v2/v2.1/known-gaps.md](docs/archive/v2/v2.1/known-gaps.md).

#### JSON CLI loopback (`/nexus/*`)

- Activation: start the desktop sidecar. JSON CLI binds `127.0.0.1:11500` (or `NEXUS_SERVING_PORT`) even when Settings > Local API server is off. OpenAI `/v1` stays off until that toggle is on. Auth is `nexus.serving.token`, `--token`, or `NEXUS_SERVING_TOKEN`.
- Validation: `nexus models list` returns JSON, or `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://127.0.0.1:11500/nexus/models`. Schema errors exit 2 with no HTTP call.
- Rollback: quit the app (no extra port once the sidecar stops). Local API `/v1` is a separate toggle and can stay off.
- Authority: loopback only, bearer required. This does not enable `/v1` completions, does not bind a non-loopback host, and does not skip ConfirmationGate on coding tools invoked through `nexus session send`.
- Docs: [docs/archive/v2/v2.1/development/json-cli.md](docs/archive/v2/v2.1/development/json-cli.md).

#### parse_document Settings checkbox

- Activation: Settings > Security, **Enable parse_document for coding sessions**, which writes `nexus.coding.parseDocument.enabled` in `~/.nexus/settings.json`. Env `NEXUS_PARSE_DOCUMENT=1` still wins. Default is false.
- Validation: with the box on, `coding.parseDocument.status` returns `{ enabled: true }` and the agent tool is registered. With it off, the tool is absent.
- Rollback: uncheck the box or set the key to false / `NEXUS_PARSE_DOCUMENT=0`. No extra files are written.
- Authority: this only registers the governed agent tool. It does not install Docling, does not skip CONFIRM or secret redaction, and does not ingest into a sidecar MemoryStore (VS Code ingest remains a second flag).
- Docs: [docs/archive/v1/v1.20/known-gaps.md](docs/archive/v1/v1.20/known-gaps.md).

# [2.0.0](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/compare/v1.20.0...v2.0.0) (2026-08-20)


### Features

* **v2.0.0:** add Chat vision routing, local STT, and an offline voice loop ([4767689](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/4767689))
* **v2.0.0:** add DANGEROUS isolated-profile browser tools for the coding agent ([30fbcaa](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/30fbcaa))
* **v2.0.0:** add Video Lab clip continuation and a gated local avatar mode ([59440cb](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/59440cb))
* **v2.0.0:** add ProjectScope, durable sandbox, and advisory memory kinds ([21089c8](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/21089c8))


### Documentation

* **v2.0.0:** reconcile known-gaps and document CI hardware gates ([07ec7be](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/07ec7be))

This is the convergence cut of the v1.18-v2.0 plan family. Earlier changelog sections already record [v1.18.0](#1180) (harness, ask inbox, ACP, OS sandbox), [v1.19.0](#1190) (LFM2.5-2.6B), [v1.19.1](#1191) (loop guards and posture dial), [v1.19.2](#1192) (modalities, Hermes, Inkling), and [v1.20.0](#1200) (document ingest). Plans: [v1.18.0](docs/archive/v1/v1.18/plans/v1.18.0-adoption-agent-harness-and-governance.md), [v1.19.0](docs/archive/v1/v1.19/plans/v1.19.0-adoption-liquid-lfm-agentic.md), [v1.19.1](docs/archive/v1/v1.19/plans/v1.19.1-adoption-agent-loop-and-guardrail-hardening.md), [v1.19.2](docs/archive/v1/v1.19/plans/v1.19.2-adoption-catalog-and-model-expansion.md), [v2.0.0](docs/archive/v2/v2.0/plans/v2.0.0-adoption-governed-autonomy-multimodal.md).


### Opt-in surfaces

#### Chat voice loop (Local Chatbot "Voice loop" checkbox)

- Activation: in Local Chatbot Explorer, check **Voice loop**. Default is off. Install catalog models `faster-whisper-large-v3` (STT) and `kokoro-82m` (TTS) through the installer for live engines. CI uses `NEXUS_AUDIO_STUB=1`.
- Validation: with the box on, the capture indicator reads "Recording -- microphone is open" while PTT or VAD is capturing. With the box off, PTT and VAD controls stay disabled.
- Rollback: uncheck **Voice loop**. The reducer resets. Installed weights stay on disk until you remove them.
- Authority: this only opens the local mic-to-STT-to-TTS loop. It does not send audio off-device, does not enable coding tools, does not skip secret redaction on transcripts, and does not register a network port.
- Docs: [README](README.md#whats-new-in-v200), [docs/archive/v2/v2.0/known-gaps.md](docs/archive/v2/v2.0/known-gaps.md) (DF-1, DF-3, DF-4).

#### Coding browser tools (local Playwright)

- Activation: the five `browser_*` tools are DANGEROUS and always confirm. Live Chromium is a local install: `npx playwright@1.55.0 install chromium`. There is no package.json Playwright dependency. Sidecar headless registers the family when `browserEnabled` is true (sidecar default).
- Validation: a confirmed `browser_navigate` to a local HTML file plus `browser_aria_snapshot` returns labelled `[origin:browser_snapshot]` text. Without Playwright, CI still passes on `InMemoryBrowser`. Set `NEXUS_BROWSER_PLAYWRIGHT=1` for the live skip-gated tests.
- Rollback: do not approve the DANGEROUS prompt. Uninstall Playwright/Chromium if you installed them. Isolated profiles live under `~/.nexus/browser-profiles/` and are not your default Chrome/Edge profile.
- Authority: this does not grant the user's logged-in browser, does not lower PermissionTiers, does not auto-approve, and does not treat page content as instructions (snapshots are screened).
- Docs: [docs/archive/v2/v2.0/browser-surface-security.md](docs/archive/v2/v2.0/browser-surface-security.md), [docs/archive/v2/v2.0/ci-hardware-gates.md](docs/archive/v2/v2.0/ci-hardware-gates.md).

#### Video Lab local talking-head (`longcat-video-avatar-1.5`)

- Activation: Hardware class `diffusion-pro` (about 20 GB+ VRAM), install catalog id `longcat-video-avatar-1.5` (official `meituan-longcat` INT8, sha256-pinned), attach a photo plus audio, and check **Generate talking-head locally. Photo and audio never leave this device.** IPC field `confirmLocalAvatar` must be true.
- Validation: below `diffusion-pro` the checkbox is hidden and `diffusion.video.audio2video` is refused. With confirm false the request is rejected. Workflow JSON records `provenance.neverLeftDevice`.
- Rollback: uncheck the confirm box; do not install the weights. Delete `~/.nexus/models/weights/longcat-video-avatar-1.5/` if already pulled. Continuation (clip chaining) is separate and does not require this catalog id.
- Authority: this does not upload photo or audio, does not enable community FP8 re-quants, does not vendor LongCat DiT Python (DF-8 stub until a scanned import), and does not skip the VRAM floor.
- Docs: [README](README.md#whats-new-in-v200), [docs/archive/v2/v2.0/known-gaps.md](docs/archive/v2/v2.0/known-gaps.md) (DF-8, DF-9).

# [1.20.0](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/compare/v1.19.2...v1.20.0) (2026-08-19)



### Features

* **v1.20.0:** wire parse_document on sidecar and VS Code hosts ([318e944](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/318e944))
* **v1.20.0:** add magic-byte document router and native Office ingest ([374f227](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/374f227))
* **v1.20.0:** let Coding attach and parse documents like Chat ([a20c21a](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/a20c21a))


### Bug Fixes

* **ci:** stop Linux hash_file mkdir on /workspace and key uv cache on pyproject.toml ([756153f](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/756153f))


### Documentation

* **v1.20.0:** add Docling comparison and document-ingest plan ([a472acd](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/a472acd))
* **v1.20.0:** defer Docling layout engine after incomplete OCR bake-off ([c4530f5](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/c4530f5))
* **v1.20.0:** close document-ingest cycle with known-gaps and CI notes ([b24b319](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/b24b319))


### Opt-in surfaces

#### parse_document agent tool (`nexus.coding.parseDocument.enabled`)

- Activation: set `"nexus.coding.parseDocument.enabled": true` in VS Code settings, or `NEXUS_PARSE_DOCUMENT=1` for sidecar/ACP/scheduler, or the same JSON key in `~/.nexus/settings.json`. Default is false. Optional memory ingest is a second flag: `"nexus.coding.parseDocument.memoryIngest.enabled": true` (VS Code + MemoryStore only).
- Validation: with the tool flag on, a coding agent can call `parse_document` on a workspace PDF, image, or Office file and the tool appears in the catalog. With the flag off, `get_tool_schema` / the tool list omit it. Chat and Coding file attach still work without this flag.
- Rollback: set the setting to false or `NEXUS_PARSE_DOCUMENT=0`. The tool is unregistered on the next session. No extra files are written. Memory rows already stored stay until you delete them.
- Authority: this only registers the governed agent tool. It does not install Docling, does not add torch to the portable OCR venv, does not open a network port, does not auto-prompt parsed text into a model, and does not skip CONFIRM / secret redaction / inbound classification. Chat and Coding attach are separate UI paths and are not this flag.
- Docs: [README](README.md#whats-new-in-v1200), [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#document-ingest-v1200), [docs/archive/v1/v1.20/known-gaps.md](docs/archive/v1/v1.20/known-gaps.md).

# [1.19.2](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/compare/v1.19.1...v1.19.2) (2026-08-19)


### Features

* **v1.19.2:** add Hermes, Inkling, modalities, and weight variants ([17a0206](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/17a0206))


### Opt-in surfaces

#### Weights variant override (`NEXUS_WEIGHTS_VARIANT`)

- Activation: set env `NEXUS_WEIGHTS_VARIANT` to a catalog variant id (for example `gguf-ud-iq1-s`), or the installer `weights_variant` field. Default is the entry's `defaultVariant` or a VRAM-aware official pick.
- Validation: install a model that declares `weights.variants` and confirm only that variant's files land under `~/.nexus/models/weights/<id>/`. An unofficial variant is rejected.
- Rollback: unset `NEXUS_WEIGHTS_VARIANT`. Already-downloaded files stay on disk until you delete them.
- Authority: this only chooses which official file set the puller verifies. It does not admit community quants, does not skip sha256, does not enable the patient tier, and does not open a network port beyond the existing Hugging Face install channel.
- Docs: [README](README.md#whats-new-in-v1192), [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#catalog-expansion-and-patient-tier-calibration-v1192).

#### Patient-tier RAM preset (`nexus.llm.patientTier.ramPreset`)

- Activation: set `"nexus.llm.patientTier.ramPreset": "laptop" | "workstation" | "max"` in settings. Default is `laptop`.
- Validation: the settings description shows that preset's expected s/token. It does not change adapter config.
- Rollback: set the setting back to `"laptop"`. No files outside settings are written.
- Authority: this is expectation copy only. It does not bundle or configure the llama.cpp offload runtime, does not download Inkling, and does not raise permission tiers.
- Docs: [README](README.md#whats-new-in-v1192), [docs/archive/v1/v1.19/known-gaps.md](docs/archive/v1/v1.19/known-gaps.md) (v1.19.2 DF-4).

# [1.19.1](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/compare/v1.19.0...v1.19.1) (2026-08-19)


### Features

* **v1.19.1:** Hub skill-native wins: grounded citations, persona cards, avatar-prep and transcript-reasoning (Phase 1) ([3f68051](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/3f68051))
* **v1.19.1:** harden agent loop, denials, posture, and provenance (Phase 2) ([ddbb258](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/ddbb258))


### Opt-in surfaces

#### Security posture dial (`nexus.coding.securityPosture`)

- Activation: set `"nexus.coding.securityPosture": "strict" | "standard" | "unattended"` in settings, or the matching VS Code / desktop Security tab control. Default is `standard`.
- Validation: with Standard, CONFIRM-tier tools still prompt. With Unattended, a CONFIRM-tier tool proceeds without that prompt, but `run_terminal` (DANGEROUS) still prompts and `rm -rf /` is still blocked. With Strict, more prompts and all tool output is screened.
- Rollback: set the setting back to `"standard"`. No files outside settings are written.
- Authority: this only changes confirmation frequency and screening strictness. It does not drop the PermissionTiers floor, does not allow hard-denied commands, does not auto-approve DANGEROUS tools, and does not open a network port. Unattended is not a no-floor mode.
- Docs: [README](README.md#whats-new-in-v1191), [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#agent-loop-and-guardrail-hardening-v1191-phase-2).

# [1.19.0](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/compare/v1.18.0...v1.19.0) (2026-08-19)


### Features

* **v1.19.0:** LFM2.5-2.6B as the low-VRAM Agentic catalog pick (Phase 1) ([58e2293](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/58e2293))
* **v1.19.0:** LFM-aware harness profile and pythonic tool parser (Phase 2) ([6a8e3f0](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/6a8e3f0))


### Bug Fixes

* **sandbox:** parse Seatbelt profiles and stage one Linux bundle ([f8c619e](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/f8c619e))
* **ci:** unblock CI sandbox tests and catalog sync ([afcb0b8](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/afcb0b8))


### Documentation

* **v1.19.0:** decline LFM2.5-8B-A1B until a local quality-per-GB win ([9f89f6d](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/9f89f6d))


### Continuous Integration

* **v1.19.0:** path-filter installer tests and run desktop vitest on develop ([976cee5](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/976cee5))


### Opt-in surfaces

This release changes no opt-in capability, installer flag, or host surface.

# [1.18.0](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/compare/v1.17.0...v1.18.0) (2026-08-17)


### Features

* **v1.18.0:** Hub skill-native mappings and llama.cpp loopback recipe (Phase 1) ([147cc39](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/147cc39))
* **v1.18.0:** live harness selector with named family profiles (Phase 2) ([6666a74](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/6666a74))
* **v1.18.0:** catalog tool-calling flags, MoE schema, and MCP tool deny (Phase 3) ([12fe79f](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/12fe79f))
* **v1.18.0:** persistent ask inbox and local agent-run scheduler (Phase 4) ([ca02605](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/ca02605))
* **v1.18.0:** loopback ACP agent on the shared serving control surface (Phase 5) ([9d88233](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/9d88233))
* **v1.18.0:** OS process sandbox around `run_terminal` (Phase 6) ([8ac11ee](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/8ac11ee))


### Bug Fixes

* **desktop:** use a c-string literal for LoadLibraryA so Windows clippy is clean ([f27bc65](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/f27bc65))
* **ci:** attach release assets by waiting for the desktop bundle and running appimagetool without FUSE ([6e601d2](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/6e601d2))
* **sandbox:** alias macOS `/var` and `/private/var` firmlink twins in writable roots so Seatbelt allows in-scope writes on GitHub runners
* **ci:** restore the skill-native "no new skill" phrase, probe live sandbox mode in the classifier test, and regenerate `docs/index.md`
* **sandbox:** drop invalid `network-outbound*` / `mach-register` Seatbelt ops that made sandbox-exec exit 65 before the child ran
* **ci:** stage one Linux `.deb` / AppImage when the cargo cache leaves multiple bundle versions


### Opt-in surfaces

#### Per-model harness selector (`nexus.coding.harnessSelector.enabled`)

- Activation: set `"nexus.coding.harnessSelector.enabled": true` in settings, or the matching VS Code setting. Default is false (`HARNESS_SELECTOR_SHIPPED_DEFAULT`).
- Validation: with the toggle on, send `/harness` in a coding session and confirm a named profile (plan-first, structured-edit, concise-loop, or minimal) is reported for the active model. With the toggle off, `/harness` reports the selector is disabled and prompt knobs match settings.
- Rollback: set the setting to false. Overlays stop applying; no files outside settings are written.
- Authority: this only changes prompt-scaffold knobs (style, thinking mode, system-prompt budget). It does not download models, raise permission tiers, auto-approve tools, or open a network port.
- Docs: [README](README.md#whats-new-in-v1180), [docs/reference/low-cost-model-optimization.md](docs/reference/low-cost-model-optimization.md).

#### ACP agent (`nexus.acp.enabled`)

- Activation: Settings > Local API server, enable the ACP toggle, or set `"nexus.acp.enabled": true`, or `NEXUS_ACP_ENABLED=1`. Reuses `nexus.serving.token`. Default off.
- Validation: with ACP on, Settings shows the shared loopback listener and `POST /acp`. `curl -i http://127.0.0.1:11500/acp` without a bearer token returns 401. With the toggle off and serving off, nothing listens on that port.
- Rollback: turn the ACP toggle off, or set `"nexus.acp.enabled": false`. The ACP mount goes away. If serving is also off, the listener stops. The token remains in `~/.nexus/settings.json` until you delete `nexus.serving.token`.
- Authority: ACP is loopback JSON-RPC only. Enabling it does not turn on OpenAI/Anthropic inference routes, does not auto-approve tools, and does not expose the filesystem. Unattended CONFIRM/DANGEROUS calls park in the ask inbox (or fail-closed if no inbox is configured).
- Docs: [README](README.md#local-api-server-opt-in), [docs/install.md](docs/install.md#after-you-install-v1180).

#### Exec sandbox (`nexus.coding.execSandbox`)

- Activation: set `"nexus.coding.execSandbox": true`, or `NEXUS_EXEC_SANDBOX=1` for the sidecar. Default off.
- Validation: run a `run_terminal` command and confirm the UI or logs say `confined` (macOS with sandbox-exec, Linux with Landlock+python3) or `partial` (Windows). With the setting off, they say `unconfined`.
- Rollback: set the setting to false or `NEXUS_EXEC_SANDBOX=0`. The next command is unconfined under the existing confirmation, denylist, and env-scrub guards. No extra artifacts to delete.
- Authority: this confines `run_terminal` spawn only. It does not skip confirmation, denylists, or the ask inbox. Windows does not kernel-enforce filesystem or network. Off or a missing backend is loud unconfined, never silent.
- Docs: [README](README.md#whats-new-in-v1180), [docs/archive/v1/v1.18/known-gaps.md](docs/archive/v1/v1.18/known-gaps.md) (DF-11).

#### Scheduled agent runs (`ask.scheduler.setEnabled`)

- Activation: desktop Admin > Ask inbox, enable a listed schedule (the built-in morning brief starts off). Equivalent IPC: `ask.scheduler.setEnabled`. Persist file: `~/.nexus/agent-schedules.json`.
- Validation: the Ask inbox panel shows the schedule as enabled. After a fire, consequential tools appear as pending asks in the same panel (they do not run silently).
- Rollback: disable the schedule in the panel, or set `enabled` to false in `~/.nexus/agent-schedules.json`. Disabling does not delete parked asks or `~/.nexus/ask-inbox.json`.
- Authority: enabling a schedule does not auto-approve CONFIRM or DANGEROUS tools, does not raise permission tiers, and does not bind a network port. Every wake checkpoints git and parks asks. Morning-brief content stays the Hub `agent-presets` / `morning-briefing` preset.
- Docs: [README](README.md#ask-inbox-and-scheduled-runs-opt-in), [docs/reference/skill-native-adoptions-v1.18.md](docs/reference/skill-native-adoptions-v1.18.md).

# [1.16.0](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/compare/v1.15.0...v1.16.0) (2026-08-16)


### Features

* **v1.16.0:** local serving gateway (Phase 1) ([67257df](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/67257df))
* **v1.16.0:** per-model performance analytics (Phase 2) ([bfaeb86](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/bfaeb86))

* **v1.16.0:** MLX-via-adapters docs + model-library UX (Phase 5) ([605a0a7](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/605a0a7))


### Opt-in surfaces

#### Local API server (`nexus.serving.enabled`)

- Activation: Settings > Local API server, or set `"nexus.serving.enabled": true` in `~/.nexus/settings.json`, or `NEXUS_SERVING_ENABLED=1`. Optional: `NEXUS_SERVING_HOST` (loopback only, default `127.0.0.1`), `NEXUS_SERVING_PORT` (default `11500`), `NEXUS_SERVING_TOKEN` (empty generates a persisted CSPRNG token).
- Validation: with the toggle on, Settings shows Running and a copyable `http://127.0.0.1:11500/v1`. `curl -i http://127.0.0.1:11500/v1/models` without a bearer token returns 401; with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` it lists installed models. With the toggle off, nothing listens on that port.
- Rollback: turn the Settings toggle off, or set `"nexus.serving.enabled": false`. The listener stops; the generated token remains in `~/.nexus/settings.json` until you delete `nexus.serving.token`. Turning the server off does not uninstall models.
- Authority: this serves model inference on loopback only. It does not expose files, terminal, tools, or memory, and it refuses to bind any non-loopback address.
- Docs: [README](README.md#local-api-server-opt-in), [docs/install.md](docs/install.md#after-you-install-v1160).

#### Document OCR models (`rapidocr-ppocrv4`, `unlimited-ocr-3b`)

- Activation: Settings > Models, install RapidOCR PP-OCRv4 (CPU, every OS) and/or Unlimited-OCR 3B (NVIDIA). Neither is auto-installed by the installer or by first launch.
- Validation: attach a PDF or image in Local Chatbot and confirm extracted text appears. RapidOCR needs no GPU; Unlimited-OCR needs a capable NVIDIA host.
- Rollback: Remove on Settings > Models. Uninstalling the model does not delete other catalog entries or Chat history.
- Authority: installing an OCR model does not send documents off the machine. Extracted text is not automatically forwarded to a chat/coding model; you choose what happens next. In-app HF install of these entries still fails digest verification until the all-zero `sha256` placeholders are rotated (LSO.P3.A); the Python installer puller is the working install path today.
- Docs: [README](README.md#document-parsing-ocr), [docs/archive/v1/v1.16/known-gaps.md](docs/archive/v1/v1.16/known-gaps.md).

`nexus.coding.parseDocument.enabled` and `nexus.coding.parseDocument.memoryIngest.enabled` exist and default off, but no host wires `parse_document` yet (LSO.P4.B/C), so they are not a shipped user-facing switch in this release.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-18

Major GA milestone consolidating the v1.4.0 -> v1.6.0 development line into the published release. Local-first, zero-outbound throughout (MCP Registry Policy clean).

### Highlights

- **Local model panel + judge fusion (opt-in).** A diverse panel of local models, fused by a local judge (the `fuse` skill), as the local stand-in for a frontier fallback. Wired into the live chat turn behind `nexus.llm.panelRouting` (default off); a local A/B measured no net win on a small coding fixture, so it ships opt-in (`PanelExecutor` / `FusionAgent` / `PanelRouter`, OF010 + OF011).
- **Local-runtime adapter registry.** Register a loopback-only inference runtime by manifest via `nexus.llm.localAdapters` (non-local endpoints rejected per the MCP Registry Policy).
- **Shareable trace export.** `nexus trace export` writes a self-contained, offline HTML session/trace viewer.
- **Session-state artifact dehydration**, **hierarchical sub-run trace nesting**, and the self-contained **Nexus-AI interactive guide**.

### Security / CI

- `dompurify` bumped to `^3.4.11` (clears 7 advisories in-range); the `protobufjs` advisory is allowlisted (optional, unreachable transitive with no in-range fix).
- All gates green: build, lint, architecture, prompts, tampering, security, prod-audit, the full TypeScript suite, and the desktop suite.

See the per-cycle docs under `docs/versions/v1/` and `docs/DEVLOG.md` for the full history.

# [0.43.0](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/compare/v0.42.0...v0.43.0) (2026-05-26)


### Features

* **v1.1.0:** phase 15 hardening and release gate static portion ([de150d7](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/commit/de150d71ff762872e7f9d0dc6b3ecb93cccfb9e7))

# [1.1.0](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0) (2026-05-26)

The stabilization-plus-expansion release that follows v1.0.0. Closes the v1.0.0 shared-core build carryforward cluster (storage-path rename, manifest IDs, npm package + publisher rename, duplicate-catalog removal, curator-cadence fallback delete, CRLF/LF snapshot normalization, SHA-pinned actions), turns the Windows-only PyQt installer into a canonical cross-platform installer (Windows + macOS + Linux), ships the renamed `nexus-coding` VS Code extension as a multi-model agentic add-on, adopts the NVIDIA SANA family as the default Image Studio + Video Lab pipeline, and upgrades the memory subsystem end-to-end (hybrid retrieval, local embedder, provenance, 12-hook lifecycle bus, Ebbinghaus decay, session replay timeline, `/recall` / `/remember` / `/forget` slash commands, opt-in contradiction resolver, file compressor).

The cycle ingests 65 carryforward items from `docs/versions/v1/v1.0.0/known-gaps.md` plus 22 new items across the agentmemory and SANA comparisons. 66 close in cycle (Phases 1-14); 33 carry forward to v1.2.0 (8 P1 + 24 P2 + 1 P3 -- all documented deferrals with placeholders, none release-blocking).

### Added

Phase 1 -- Shared-core decision + carryforward closure (commit `ec3ff0e`):
- Shared-core ADR at `docs/versions/v1/v1.1.0/development/decisions/shared-core-build.md` records option (a) -- project references with `composite: true` -- as the chosen strategy.
- Storage-path rename: `~/.gemma-code/` -> `~/.nexus/` cascaded across `src/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`. The `nexusHome()` helper is the single source of truth.
- Settings `package.json` `deprecationMessage` injection for every legacy `gemma-code.*` schema entry.
- Curator-cadence fallback deleted from `AgentLoop`; `IdleTimeScheduler` is the sole curator entry point.
- CRLF/LF snapshot normalization across `SubAgentManager.characterization.test.ts` (Windows / Linux parity).
- SHA-pin enforcement against the `shell-build.yml` workflow actions.

Phase 2 -- Rebrand + sidecar core extraction (commit `de219a5`):
- VS Code manifest IDs flip from `gemma-code.*` to `nexus.coding.*`; npm package + publisher rename to `nexus-coding`.
- Sidecar duplicate model catalogs deleted in favour of the canonical `core/registry/` source.

Phase 3 -- Coding-module codemod + first sub-tree migration (commit `f3429c4`):
- `scripts/dev/rewrite-imports.mjs` -- generic import-rewriting codemod consumed by Phase 3 + future sub-tree migrations.
- `src/utils/` -> `modules/coding/utils/` migration (6 files moved, 65 importers rewritten).

Phase 4 -- Memory provenance + HookBus + secret pre-index filter (commit `9323352`):
- `MemoryEntry.lifecycleProvenance: {sessionId, hookKind, toolName?, parentSpanId?}` field on every memory write.
- SQLite migration adds `provenance TEXT NULL` + `scope_id TEXT NULL` to `memories`, `episodic_events`, `graph_relations` with helper indexes. Schema version bumped to 3.
- `core/lifecycle/HookBus.ts` defines a 12-variant `LifecycleEvent` discriminated union; `InProcessHookBus` wraps `TelemetryBus` so existing trace consumers see the events. `AgentLoop.run` / `_runToolCall` / `spawnSubAgent` emit five of the twelve hooks today; four remain deferred to Phase 1b alongside the `src/runtime/` migration.
- `core/observability/redactSecrets.ts` consolidates the trace-side patterns into a single string-in / string-out scrubber (AWS keys, GitHub PATs classic + fine-grained, Slack tokens, JWTs, PEM private-key blocks, env-style assignments). Wired into `MemoryStore.save(...)` so every memory write is scrubbed before SQLite insert. Adopts agentmemory A8 + A5 + A7.

Phase 5 -- Hybrid retrieval + local embedder + warm-rebuild worker (commit `afac447`):
- `core/memory/LocalEmbedder.ts` wraps `@xenova/transformers` + the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` ONNX weights (~80 MB; production hosts source from `~/.nexus/runtimes/embedder/`). Falls back to a deterministic 384-dim hash sketch when the optional dependency is absent (CI-friendly).
- `core/memory/Bm25Index.ts` builds an inverted index over `memory_entries` with 5 ms median rebuild on memory write.
- `core/memory/HybridRetriever.ts` fuses BM25 + dense + graph traversal via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (k=60 default; exposed via `nexus.memory.rrf.k`).
- `core/memory/WarmRebuildWorker.ts` reads all `memory_entries` rows and embeds them in batches of 32 on first launch or when the indexes are detected stale via a hash-of-row-count fingerprint. Adopts agentmemory A1 + A2.

Phase 6 -- Memory CLI + Ebbinghaus decay + slash commands (commit `c8d9e0b`):
- `nexus memory audit --since <date>` prints a tabular log of memory writes with provenance.
- `nexus memory export --out <path.jsonl>` and `nexus memory import` (round-trip integrity asserted at the unit level).
- `nexus memory decay --now` fires the sweep manually for debugging.
- `/recall <query>` (hybrid top-K), `/remember <text>` (working-tier observation), `/forget --id <uuid>` or `/forget --pattern <regex>`.
- `core/memory/DecaySweep.ts` implements the closed-form Ebbinghaus retention curve `R(t) = exp(-t/halfLife * ln(2))` with per-tier half-lives (working = 24 h, episodic = 7 d, semantic = 30 d, graph = 365 d). Eviction rule: `retention < 0.05 AND accessCount < 3`. Adopts agentmemory A3 + A10 + A11 + A12.
- Memory panel "Forget" button per row (signals via `onForget` callback; IPC delete pipeline clusters with the v1.2.0 `MemoryStore` adapter sweep).

Phase 7 -- Session replay timeline (commit `2864f68`):
- TraceDashboard `<TimelineScrubber>` with play / pause / speed (0.5x / 1x / 2x / 4x).
- "Compare two sessions" view diffs trace deltas side-by-side. Adopts agentmemory A6.

Phase 8 -- DevAI-Hub closures + skill hot-reload + AgentLoop skill provenance (commit `fffee43`):
- `core/skills/SkillsReloader.ts` with 200 ms debounce, `onReload`/`onError` callbacks, graceful behaviour when the `ACTIVE` pointer does not yet exist.
- Weekly auto-sync worker factory + bootstrap registration on `IdleTimeScheduler`.
- `nexus skills install user/<name> --from <url>` + `nexus skills remove user/<name>` with documented allowlist + `PromptInjectionScanner` + path-clamped writes under `~/.nexus/skills/user/`.
- `filterSlashCommandsWithSkills(input, skills, {preferUpstream})` orders devai-hub variants first when `nexus.skills.preferUpstream=true`.
- `AgentLoop.setCurrentSkill(...)` + `lifecycle.skill.entry` fires at slash-command entry; trace spans for tool calls inside a skill body carry `skill.{id, namespace, provenance}` attributes.

Phase 9 -- Opt-in memory consolidation (commit `1307ff2`):
- `core/memory/ContradictionResolver.ts` adjudicates conflicting semantic-tier entries via a local Ollama prompt; default off, gated by `nexus.memory.consolidation.enabled`.
- `nexus memory compress --file <path>` summarizes long files into structured facts via the same local Ollama; `/memory-compress <path>` slash command wired to the same code path. Adopts agentmemory A4 + A9 (gated, opt-in).

Phase 10 -- VS Code extension thin-adapter rewrite (commit `08e14dd`):
- `src/extension.ts` drops from 478 to 64 lines; activation dispatches between `src/activation/proxy.ts` and `src/activation/extensionOnly.ts` via `discoverDesktopDaemon()`.
- Compat shim tightened to once-per-session deprecation logs for legacy `gemma-code.<cmd>` keybindings.

Phase 11 -- Nexus VS Code extension (multi-model agentic surface, commit `093be67`):
- `ModelDropdown`, `PlanArtifact`, `AutoModeStream`, `MemorySnapshotView`, `SlashAutocomplete`, `SessionList`, `McpBridge`, `SettingsBridge` -- the seven new `core/coding/*` modules form the agentic surface.
- Parity test suite + proxy / IPC-client wiring (100 new test cases).
- Five new IPC method schemas wired into `desktop/sidecar/src/protocol.ts` with `implemented: true`: `models.list`, `coding.chat.autocomplete`, `mcp.list`, `mcp.invoke`, `settings.get`, `settings.set`.
- Model dropdown is **selectable across all installed local models** (not just Gemma 4); the daemon's `models.list` enumerates Ollama-resident models for the picker.

Phase 12 -- Image Studio upgrade (NVIDIA SANA family, commit `563c817`):
- SANA-1.6B replaces SDXL Turbo as the default 1024px image model (Apache-2.0 weights).
- Sana-Sprint speed tier ("Fast Preview", 1-step Flow-DPM-Solver).
- SANA 2K + 4K behind `DiffusionTier` gating.
- SANA 4-bit (SVDQuant variant via `nunchaku`) on the `diffusion-low` 8 GB tier (operator-pending license verification under 12.4.P2.GG).
- SANA-ControlNet integrates with the existing pose / depth / canny preprocessors.
- Flow-DPM-Solver appears as a sampler option.
- DC-AE-f32c32 VAE registration.
- Adopts SANA S1, S2, S3, S4, S7, S8, S9, S10.

Phase 13 -- Video Lab Fast 720p tier (SANA-Video 2B, commit `1dabb27`):
- SANA-Video 2B joins the catalog as the "Fast 720p" tier between LTX-Video and CogVideoX.
- Video Lab "Fast 720p" preset is visible and selectable; sampler dropdown widens with `flow-dpm-solver`.
- Adopts SANA S5.

Phase 14 -- Cross-OS installer with hardware + disk-aware model picker (commit `0ead8f3`):
- `HostProfile` detection auto-identifies host OS + arch + GPU vendor.
- OS-aware provisioner dispatch: CUDA on Windows + Linux NVIDIA, Metal Performance Shaders on Apple Silicon, ROCm-aware fallback on Linux AMD, CPU-only fallback elsewhere.
- macOS provisioners: Metal + Ollama for macOS + Homebrew-style ffmpeg.
- Linux provisioners: CUDA + ROCm + CPU fallback + Ollama via the official Linux script.
- Live disk-aware footer + 10 GB OS reserve (configurable via `nexus.installer.diskReserveGB`).
- Text / Image / Video / Audio tabbed model picker fed by `core/registry/catalog.json` + `recommended.json` with hardware compatibility badges and disk-aware checkbox greying.
- Nexus VS Code extension add-on page with `code` / `code-insiders` / `cursor` auto-detection.
- Final disk + hardware guard at "Begin Installation" with re-detection and a bounce-back to the picker on failure.
- macOS DMG and Linux AppImage outer-shell workflows promoted to `push: tags` with payload-fetch + PyInstaller freeze + create-dmg / appimagetool assembly.
- Cross-OS payload fetcher at `scripts/installer/build/fetch-payload.py` parameterized by `--os` + `--arch` with SHA-256 pinning via `versions.lock.json`.
- Storage Review page with runtime / models / DevAI-Hub / reserve / net coloring.
- Cross-OS first-launch migration shim (Python-side).
- Three RTM smoke checklists at `docs/versions/v1/v1.1.0/installer-smoke-{windows,macos,linux}.md`.

Phase 15 -- Hardening + release gate (this commit):
- Version bump across `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `desktop/package.json`, `desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `scripts/installer/pyqt/pyproject.toml`, `scripts/installer/pyqt/src/nexus_installer/__init__.py`, and `scripts/installer/build/nsis/nexus-setup.nsi`.
- `docs/versions/v1/v1.1.0/distribution.md` -- distribution channels mirroring the v1.0.0 structure across three OS surfaces + the renamed Marketplace listing.
- `docs/versions/v1/v1.1.0/release-notes.md` -- user-facing release content.
- `docs/versions/v1/v1.1.0/review/synthesis.md` -- static deep-review synthesis (live `/run-deep-review` chain operator-gated and tracked as OA-V1.1.0-15-DR-A through DR-D).
- `docs/versions/v1/v1.1.0/known-gaps.md` finalized: Phase 15 closures appended, Section 3 summary recomputed, Section 4 carryforward map populated, status flipped from `in-progress` to `finalized at v1.1.0 release`.

### Changed

- Default 1024px image model: SDXL Turbo -> SANA-1.6B (reversible via the model dropdown).
- VS Code Marketplace listing: `gemma-code` -> `nexus-coding` (legacy listing carries a transition note pointing at the renamed listing through the v1.2.0 compat window).
- Curator entry point: `IdleTimeScheduler` is the sole curator dispatcher; the legacy `AgentLoop._runOneIteration` curator block is removed.
- Storage paths: `~/.gemma-code/` -> `~/.nexus/` (POSIX symlink + Windows side-by-side dir for one-cycle compat).
- Memory retrieval: substring search -> hybrid (BM25 + dense + graph via RRF, k=60). Substring fast-path retained for corpora <100 entries via `nexus.memory.hybridMinCorpus`.

### Deferred to v1.2.0

- 12 of 13 `src/` -> `modules/coding/` sub-trees remain open under 1.4.P1.B (per-sub-tree status table maintained in `docs/versions/v1/v1.1.0/known-gaps.md`).
- `MemoryStore` adapter cluster: `MemoryStoreWarmRebuildSource`, `MemoryStoreDecayProvider`, `MemoryStoreAuditLog`, `MemoryStoreExportSource`, `MemoryStoreSettingsStore` -- all clustered with the v1.2.0 first commit.
- Audio module pillar.
- Direct-download landing page (`https://nexus.bendourthe.com/download`) -- deferred to v1.1.1 per OA-05.
- Legacy `gemma-code.<cmd>` keybindings + `gemma-check` CLI alias removal (compat window closes in v1.2.0).
- Node-graph advanced tab.

### Operator-action carryforwards

Live operator-driven items required to close v1.1.0 (tracked in `docs/versions/v1/v1.0.0/operator-actions.md` plus `docs/versions/v1/v1.1.0/operator-actions.md`):

- OA-01 -- EV Code Signing certificate procurement + Windows Authenticode signing (carried forward from v1.0.0).
- OA-08 -- Live golden-task replay against `gemma4:e4b` / `llama3.1:8b` / `qwen2.5-coder:7b`.
- OA-09 -- Real-GPU bench (extended in v1.1.0 for SANA-1.6B / Sana-Sprint / SANA 2K / SANA 4K / SANA INT4 / SANA-ControlNet / SANA-Video 2B).
- OA-10 -- Live `nexus skills sync` against `bendourthe/DevAI-Hub`.
- OA-11 -- macOS Developer ID + notarization.
- OA-12 -- Linux AppImage RTM smoke on Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04 / Fedora 40.
- OA-V1.1.0-10A -- Publish the renamed `nexus-coding` Marketplace listing.
- OA-V1.1.0-10B -- Update the legacy `gemma-code` listing with the transition note.
- OA-V1.1.0-12A -- Rotate SANA placeholder SHA-256 digests in `core/registry/catalog.json`.
- OA-V1.1.0-15-DR-A/B/C/D -- Live `/run-deep-review` + `/run-security-audit` + `/run-penetration-test --depth=deep` + `semantic-release --dry-run` capture.

# [1.0.0](https://github.com/bendourthe/Nexus-AI/compare/v0.32.0...v1.0.0) (2026-05-18)

The first production release of Nexus -- a local-first agentic AI workstation that hosts four pillars (Agentic AI Coding, Local Chatbot Explorer, Image Studio, Video Lab) inside a single Tauri 2.x desktop shell, backed by a Node sidecar (LLM + chat orchestration) and a Python sidecar (Stable Diffusion / video pipelines). The cycle pivots the project from the v0.x "Gemma Code" VS Code extension into a four-pillar desktop product, completes the rebrand sweep, and lands a Windows-first single-binary installer with a DevAI-Hub skill-sync pathway.

This is a SemVer major-version bump from v0.30.1. Identifier, settings, storage path, and CLI surface migrations preserve backwards compatibility through a one-cycle compat window (legacy `gemma-code.*` keys, `~/.gemma-code/` storage, and the `gemma-check` CLI alias are all still honoured with deprecation logs; they are scheduled for removal in v1.1.0).

### Added

Tauri desktop shell (Phase 1):
- Tauri 2.x Rust core (`desktop/src-tauri/`) that hosts a React 19 + Vite 5 web frontend and spawns a Node 22 sidecar process over JSON-RPC.
- IPC primitives: request/response `ipc_call` Tauri command, typed `protocol.ts` envelope with Zod schemas, error envelope with structured `code` + `details`.
- Dashboard with four module cards (Coding / Chat / Image / Video), TopBar with search + notifications + extra-buttons slot, Sidebar with module navigation + design-token styleguide route.
- Design tokens (`desktop/src/styles/tokens.css`) consumed via CSS variables; styleguide page renders every token visually for regression checks.

Rebrand + core extraction (Phase 2):
- `core/` shared-core surface (storage, settings, telemetry, registry, video utilities) with TypeScript project-references build.
- `core/storage/StorageMigration.ts` migrates `~/.gemma-code/` -> `~/.nexus/` on first launch; POSIX symlink retains backwards compatibility on macOS / Linux, side-by-side dirs on Windows.
- `SettingsCompat` shim resolves every legacy `gemma-code.*` settings key to its canonical `nexus.*` counterpart with a runtime deprecation log.
- Dependency-cruiser boundary rules enforce `core/` -> `modules/coding/` (and `modules/chat/`, etc.) is one-way; reverse imports are CI-blocked.
- VS Code extension code identifiers renamed (`GemmaCodePanel` -> `NexusCodingPanel`, `GemmaRuntime` -> `NexusCodingRuntime`).
- `nexus` CLI binary (still ships `gemma-check` as a compat alias) covering `nexus skills sync`, `nexus skills list`, and the existing check / golden / curate subcommands.

Coding module (Phase 3):
- `desktop/sidecar/` Node sidecar workspace hosting the new `CodingSessionManager` (placeholder responder during the compat window; Phase 5 follow-on swaps in the real `NexusCodingRuntime`).
- Coding-module IPC surface: `coding.session.create`, `coding.session.sendMessage`, `coding.session.event`, `coding.memory.snapshot`, `coding.trace.subscribe`, `coding.sessions.list`.
- Desktop Coding panel (`desktop/src/modules/coding/`) with chat input, message list, slash-command autocomplete (12 canonical commands), `<MemoryPanel>` / `<TraceDashboardPanel>` / `<SessionListPanel>` siblings.
- IdleTimeScheduler (`desktop/sidecar/src/runtime/idleScheduler.ts`) -- registers curator (5 min idle / 12 h cadence) and reflect (10 min idle / 24 h cadence) workers; closes v0.9.0 known-gap 10.N.Q.
- `desktop/src/desktop/daemonDiscovery.ts` and the VS Code adapter detection branch -- groundwork for the thin-adapter flip in v1.1.0.

Chat module (Phase 4):
- `modules/chat/` SQLite-backed `ChatExplorerStore` (folder tree with drag/drop, chat CRUD, search, breadcrumbs, ancestor traversal).
- Desktop Chat panel (`desktop/src/modules/chat/ChatPage.tsx`) with `<FolderTree>`, `<ChatHeader>`, `<MessageList>`, model selector, tools toggle.
- `MemoryHub` scope filter -- in-memory `scopeId` propagation across working / episodic / semantic / graph layers; `ChatScopedMemory` bridge translates folder ancestry into a scope chain. SQLite column migration deferred to v1.1.0.
- TopBar search adapter signature for folder / chat / memory results; default Dashboard wires folder + chat sources.

Model Registry (Phase 5):
- `core/registry/ModelCatalog.ts` + `core/registry/models.json` -- single canonical model catalog (LLM, image, video, LoRA, ControlNet) with provenance, license, source protocol, recommended VRAM tier, SHA-256 digest.
- `core/registry/NexusModelRegistry` -- per-host installed-model index at `~/.nexus/registry/models.json`, atomic write, version-aware, recoverable.
- `core/registry/Downloader` -- HTTP/HTTPS + HuggingFace + Ollama-protocol downloader with resumable transfer, SHA-256 verification, progress events, cancel.
- `core/registry/ModelPinRegistry` (ported from `src/storage/`) -- per-model "keep loaded in VRAM" pinning; sidecar bootstrap rehydrates pin set from `SettingsStore`'s `nexus.llm.modelPins`; resolver() callback drives `StreamingPipeline`'s existing `KeepAliveResolver` seam.
- Settings -> Models UI (`desktop/src/pages/settings/ModelsSettings.tsx`) with Installed / Available / External sections, type filters, search, disk-usage summary, install progress + cancel, remove, reveal.

Image Studio (Phase 6):
- `runtimes/diffusion/` Python sidecar (JSON-RPC over stdio) -- pluggable pipeline registry, smart-offload decision via `device.choose_offload`, deterministic stub executors for CI, real PyTorch executor seams.
- SDXL Turbo, SDXL 1.0, FLUX Schnell, SD 1.5 pipelines (text2img, img2img, inpaint, outpaint) + LoRA + ControlNet preprocessor stubs (pose / depth / canny).
- Workflow-metadata embedding -- every output PNG carries the prompt, sampler, steps, CFG, seed, model id, LoRA stack, ControlNet stack as PNG `tEXt` chunks for round-trip reproducibility.
- Desktop Image Studio panel (`desktop/src/modules/image/ImageStudioPage.tsx`) with prompt form, model dropdown, advanced LoRA / ControlNet, output gallery, live latent preview poll, drag-into-prompt.

Video Lab (Phase 7):
- Python sidecar video pipelines: LTX-Video, Stable Video Diffusion (SVD), CogVideoX 5B / 2B (text2video + image2video).
- Video-aware offload decision (`_upgrade_for_video`), `vram_scope` context manager, thumbnail-strip during generation, MP4 output with embedded workflow JSON via ffmpeg metadata.
- Desktop Video Lab panel (`desktop/src/modules/video/VideoLabPage.tsx`) with prompt form, mode toggle (text2video / image2video), model dropdown, timeline preview scrubber, thumbnail strip, output gallery, drag-into-image-source.
- ffmpeg / ffprobe injection seam (`FfmpegContext`) -- defaults to `NEXUS_FFMPEG_PATH` / `NEXUS_FFPROBE_PATH` env vars; installer sets these in Phase 9.

GpuScheduler + telemetry (Phase 8):
- `core/scheduler/GpuScheduler.ts` -- single-GPU job queue with FIFO scheduling, foreground bump (Coding token-gen pre-empts a queued image job), VRAM gating (rejects jobs that would exceed `availableVramGB`), cancel, scheduler telemetry envelope.
- `core/telemetry/GpuTelemetrySource.ts` -- 2 Hz pluggable poller with `parseNvidiaSmiCsv` (Win + Linux), `parseAppleSystemProfiler` (macOS), `buildCpuFallbackSample` (no-GPU graceful-degrade).
- `core/config/DiffusionTier.ts` -- four-tier hardware classification (`diffusion-none`, `-low`, `-mid`, `-pro`) with per-tier image + video defaults (resolution, sampler, steps, model, allowControlNet, parallelJobs, video.enabled).
- `<LocalModelStatus>` widget -- GPU usage gauge, queue summary, hover tooltip, click-to-open queue modal; `<LocalModelStatusDock>` floats it on every non-dashboard route.
- Closes v0.9.0 known-gap 10.N.A (ModelPinRegistry wiring) and 10.N.R (real telemetry source).

Single-binary installer (Phase 9):
- PyQt5 cross-platform wizard (`scripts/installer/pyqt/`) with Welcome -> EULA -> Components -> CUDA -> Python venv -> Node -> Models -> Install -> Done page flow.
- Per-provisioner modules: `cuda_provisioner.py`, `diffusion_venv_provisioner.py`, `node_provisioner.py`, `ollama_provisioner.py`, `devai_hub_provisioner.py`, `recommended_models.py`.
- NSIS outer installer template (`scripts/installer/build/nsis/nexus-setup.nsi`) covering registry entries, Start Menu / Desktop shortcuts, `.nexus-workflow.json` file association, `nexus://` URL handler, data-preservation uninstaller.
- Tauri icons under `desktop/src-tauri/icons/` (procedurally rendered teal-on-charcoal "N" via `scripts/desktop/generate-icons.py`; final designer art tracked as a v1.0.1 polish item).
- Brand assets: `assets/branding/` logo set, design-token alignment with `desktop/src/styles/tokens.css`.
- CI workflows: `installer-build.yml` (Windows), workflow_dispatch placeholders for `installer-macos.yml` + `installer-linux.yml` (deferred to v1.0.1 / v1.0.2).

DevAI-Hub skill sync (Phase 10):
- `core/skills/DevAIHubSyncer.ts` -- dependency-injected syncer (resolveLatestTag / sparseClone / tarballFetch / hasGit) with full diff + scan + apply pipeline.
- `nexus skills sync` CLI subcommand (`--tag`, `--apply`, `--dry-run`).
- Namespaced `SkillCatalog` (`devai-hub/<name>` vs `user/<name>`) with diverged-flag detection.
- `~/.nexus/skills/devai-hub/<tag>/` content-addressed tag dirs + `ACTIVE` pointer for tag rotation.
- Prompt-injection scanner (`core/skills/PromptInjectionScanner.ts`) blocks suspicious skill content before it reaches `~/.nexus/skills/`.
- Settings -> Skills UI (`desktop/src/pages/settings/SkillsSettings.tsx`) with "Sync now", tag picker, install/divergence indicators, "Use as default" for diverged skills, "Auto-sync weekly" toggle (default OFF).
- Skill provenance attribution (`Tracer.setCurrentSkill(...)`) folds `skill.{id, namespace, provenance}` into every `tool_call` / `sub_agent` span.

Release hardening (Phase 11):
- `docs/versions/v1/v1.0.0/release-signing.md` -- Authenticode (Windows) workflow + macOS notarization workflow placeholder.
- `docs/versions/v1/v1.0.0/release-notes.md` -- user-facing release announcement with module screenshots and v1.1.0 teaser.
- `docs/versions/v1/v1.0.0/rtm-smoke.md` -- operator-driven RTM smoke checklist (fresh Win 11 VM, 4 modules end-to-end, target <= 90 min total).
- `docs/versions/v1/v1.0.0/distribution.md` -- distribution-channel runbook (GitHub Releases, VS Code Marketplace re-publish, optional direct-download site).
- `docs/versions/v1/v1.0.0/operator-actions.md` -- consolidated operator checklist covering live-GPU benches, code-signing cert procurement, SHA-256 rotation, RTM execution.
- `docs/versions/v1/v1.0.0/review/synthesis.md`, `security-audit.md`, `penetration-test.md` -- consolidated Phase 11 review artifacts.

### Changed

- Project identity, repository remote, npm/Cargo package names: `gemma-code` -> `nexus` (with VS Code extension manifest IDs and Marketplace listing rename deferred to v1.1.0 per known-gap 2.P1.J / 2.P2.K).
- Settings key namespace: `gemma-code.*` -> `nexus.*`. Legacy keys still honoured via `SettingsCompat`; runtime deprecation log surfaces every legacy read.
- Storage path: `~/.gemma-code/` -> `~/.nexus/`. Migration on first launch; legacy dir preserved (POSIX symlink on macOS / Linux, side-by-side on Windows). 9 homedir-based call sites in `src/` and 4 workspace-local sites still read the legacy path -- mechanical rename deferred to v1.1.0 per known-gap 2.P1.G.
- VS Code extension scope: thin-adapter target. The full in-process engine is still hosted by the extension during the compat window; the daemon-discovery + activation-branch hooks ship in v1.0.0, the rewrite to a true thin adapter is staged for v1.1.0 per 3.P1.O.
- Coding panel: now hosted by the Tauri desktop process (`desktop/src/modules/coding/`). The VS Code extension panel remains until v1.1.0.
- CLI rename: primary binary is `nexus`. `gemma-check` is retained as a compat alias (logs a deprecation warning); removed in v1.1.0.

### Deprecated

- `gemma-code.*` settings keys (removed in v1.1.0).
- `~/.gemma-code/` storage path (removed in v1.1.0; data migrated by `StorageMigration` on first v1.0.0 launch).
- `gemma-check` CLI alias (removed in v1.1.0; use `nexus check`).
- VS Code extension manifest IDs `gemma-code-sidebar`, `gemma-code.<command>`, `gemma-code.chatView`, `.memoryPanel`, `.traceDashboard` (renamed to `nexus.coding.*` in v1.1.0 per known-gap 2.P1.J).
- VS Code extension npm package name `gemma-code` (renamed to `nexus-coding` in v1.1.0 per known-gap 2.P2.K).

### Removed

- Pre-rebrand identifiers `GemmaCodePanel`, `GemmaRuntime`, and their import paths under `src/llm/` / `src/storage/` (replaced by `NexusCodingPanel`, `NexusCodingRuntime`, and `core/llm/`, `core/storage/` import paths; legacy modules are compat re-exports).

### Fixed

- v0.9.0 known-gap 10.N.A (ModelPinRegistry wiring): Phase 5 ports the registry to `core/registry/ModelPinRegistry.ts`, persists pin set through `SettingsStore` (`nexus.llm.modelPins`), and threads `resolver()` into `StreamingPipeline`'s existing `KeepAliveResolver` seam.
- v0.9.0 known-gap 10.N.Q (IdleTimeScheduler wiring): Phase 3 sidecar bootstrap registers curator + reflect workers via the new `desktop/sidecar/src/runtime/idleScheduler.ts`; verified by a 30-minute synthetic-idle integration test.
- v0.9.0 known-gap 10.N.R (real telemetry source): Phase 8 ships `core/telemetry/GpuTelemetrySource.ts` with platform parsers and the CPU fallback; `<LocalModelStatus>` widget consumes the real stream when the sidecar nvidia-smi spawn lands (operator-driven, tracked as v1.0.0 8.P1.UU).
- v0.9.0 known-gap 10.N.T (operator-action consolidation): Phase 11 ships `docs/versions/v1/v1.0.0/operator-actions.md` as the consolidated operator checklist for v1.0.0; future cycles inherit the same file layout.
- Pre-existing Phase 2 test failures (`SubAgentManager.characterization.test.ts` CRLF/LF snapshot mismatches; `workflow-discipline.test.ts` SHA-pin enforcement) recorded under v1.0.0 known-gap 2.P3.L and tracked as a Phase 11 / v1.0.1 fix.
- Phase 9 CI block on missing `tauri::Manager` import (`desktop/src-tauri/src/sidecar.rs::app.path().resolve()` against Tauri 2.11) -- import added in lockstep with the icons.

- Windows installer Authenticode signing workflow documented at `docs/versions/v1/v1.0.0/release-signing.md`. Actual signing requires the operator-procured EV Code Signing certificate (tracked as v1.0.0 operator action OA-01).
- macOS notarization workflow documented (deferred to v1.0.1 per Phase 9.8 + known-gap 9.P2.EEE).
- Prompt-injection scanner (`core/skills/PromptInjectionScanner.ts`) screens every skill body before it lands in `~/.nexus/skills/`; the DevAI-Hub sync pathway routes every fetched skill through the scanner; the un-namespaced `nexus skills install` CLI path is stubbed (P2 known-gap 10.P2.III) so no scanner-bypassing install surface ships in v1.0.0.
- Path-clamping on `~/.nexus/skills/user/` writes (resolved + parent-dir check before write).
- HTTPS-only model downloader; rejects `file://`, `localhost`, internal IP ranges; SHA-256 digest verification gates every non-Ollama install (catalog digests for HTTP-sourced models are placeholders pending v1.0.0 release-gate rotation per known-gap 5.P2.CC).
- Sidecar process runs as user (not admin); `~/.nexus/` permissions are user-only (verified in `docs/versions/v1/v1.0.0/review/security-audit.md`).
- Settings UI does not echo secrets; `SECRET_PATHS` redaction in `Tracer` covers `apiKey`, `password`, `token`, `secret`, `Bearer ` headers.
- ffmpeg shell-out (`core/video/WorkflowMetadata.ts`) builds argv arrays (no shell interpolation); injected `spawnFn` accepts argv-only.

## [0.7.0] -- 2026-05-14

Adoption cycle driven by `docs/archive/versions/v0/v0.7.0/comparison-multi-source.md` (S1-S7 multi-source competitive review). Closes every P1 carryover from the v0.6.0 known-gaps catalog in Phase 0 (panel hoist down to 305 lines via ADR-0011; `marked` v4 -> v12 migration; mutation-testing gap fixes across `policy.ts` / `ActionClassifier.ts` / `terminal.ts` / `filesystem.ts`; `Orchestrator.test.ts` re-included in Stryker). Then adopts the C-items from buckets 1-3 of the comparison report: a deterministic compaction stack expansion plus a model-callable compress tool (ADR-0012), an Instructions / Memory / Context / Archive memory file architecture (ADR-0014), a webview render protocol with seven new chat primitives (ADR-0013), per-model context-limit overrides, six new skills, multi-harness skill packaging plus a standalone `gemma-check` CLI, an optional HNSW vector index with linear-scan fallback, and post-N-edits audit / testgaps background workers. Three new ADRs (0012-0014) capture the material decisions. The v0.5.0 retrospective `>= 40%` token-savings claim is now measured against the live-Ollama v0.4.0 + v0.6.0 baselines (operator-action; see Fixed below).

### Added

- `compress` tool (permission-tier 0, model-callable) with range and message modes; integrates with `ContextCompactor` as the model-driven escape hatch on top of the deterministic stack. See [ADR-0012](./docs/adr/0012-model-callable-compress-tool.md).
- `Deduplication` and `PurgeErrors` compaction strategies prepended to the existing `ToolResultClearing -> SlidingWindow -> CodeBlockTruncation -> RegenerateFromSource -> LlmSummary -> EmergencyTrim` ladder.
- `/compact context | sweep | decompress | recompress | manual` slash-command verbs surface every strategy at the chat level.
- Per-model context-limit overrides via `gemma-code.modelContextLimits: Record<string, number>`; the override replaces the global `maxTokens` when the active model matches.
- `Instructions / Memory / Context / Archive` on-disk memory file architecture under `~/.gemma-code/memory/<workspace-id>/`. Deterministic merge precedence: on-disk file wins over the SQLite store for the same key. See [ADR-0014](./docs/adr/0014-memory-file-architecture.md).
- Manual `MemoryPanel` webview with "Promote to Memory.md" action; rows map `decision -> Decisions`, `preference -> Preferences`, `error_resolution -> Corrections`, `file_pattern -> Patterns`, fallback `Preferences`.
- `/memory forget | export | import` slash-command verbs. (Write-side `/memory prune --apply` and `/memory lint --apply` remain deferred; see "Explicitly NOT in v0.7.0".)
- Webview render protocol (ADR-0013) emits seven new chat primitives from `src/panels/webview/render/`: completion report block, todo block, inline diff cards, action-type tags, numbered permission prompts (with Yes/No alias preserved), "Thought for Ns" meta-rows, and queued-message field shape. See [ADR-0013](./docs/adr/0013-webview-render-protocol.md).
- Six new skills under `.claude/skills/`: `polish`, `critique`, `distill`, `harden`, `animate`, `build-second-brain` (the last requires the v0.7.0 memory file architecture to be useful).
- Multi-harness skill packaging via `npm run package:skills`; emits adapter ZIPs for Claude Code, Cursor (best-effort `.cursor/rules/<slug>.md` transform), and OpenCode under `dist/skills-<harness>/`.
- Standalone `gemma-check` CLI under `bin/gemma-check.mjs` (`npm run check`); ships the four deterministic-check rules used by the audit background worker. See `docs/archive/versions/v0/v0.7.0/development/cli-gemma-check.md`.
- Optional HNSW vector index for `MemoryStore.searchByEmbedding` backed by `hnswlib-node` as an `optionalDependency`. Linear-scan fallback path is preserved unconditionally so environments where the native binary fails to load still work.
- Background workers (audit, testgaps) triggered post-N-edits. Workers are explicitly NOT timer-driven; only post-edit cadence per the cross-cutting risk note in comparison Section 13.
- 21 deterministic in-process benchmarks captured at `tests/benchmarks/baselines/v0.7.0.json` (live-Ollama benches auto-skip when `OLLAMA_URL` is unset).
- `tests/golden/baselines/v0.7.0.json` placeholder with `status: deferred-to-operator` and `operatorProcedure` documented; the live-Ollama golden suite is operator-action mirroring v0.6.0 known-gaps Section 1.1.

### Changed

- Numbered permission prompts (`1 / 2 / 3 / 4`) replace the Yes / No modal as the primary keyboard contract. Yes / No remain as keyboard aliases for backwards compatibility.
- Per-model context-limit override (`gemma-code.modelContextLimits[model]`) takes precedence over the global `gemma-code.maxTokens` when the active model has an entry.
- `Yes-for-all` permission decisions now persist to workspace settings instead of the in-memory session scope; the persistence key is the action signature so the decision survives a panel reload.
- `scripts/check-bench-regressions.mjs` `extractBenchmarks` now handles both the legacy `files[].tasks[]` vitest shape and the current `files[].groups[].benchmarks[]` shape so the regression gate keeps working across vitest 1.5 -> 1.6 output changes.

### Deprecated

- None.

### Removed

- None. (The `gemma-code.gpuTier` removal landed in v0.6.0; no further setting removals this cycle.)

### Fixed

- v0.6.0 Phase 0 close-out (all items in `docs/archive/versions/v0/v0.7.0/known-gaps.md` Section 2-4):
  - `GemmaCodePanel.ts` 305 lines (was 935; v0.6.0 target was < 400). Construction graph extracted to `ChatPanelBootstrap.ts` and static factories on `ChatController` (`buildContextCompactor`, `buildSubAgentManager`, `buildOrchestrator`, `buildAgentLoop`, `buildStreamingPipeline`). Helpers: `ChatPanelInit.ts`, `ChatStatusReporter.ts`, `ChatMessageRouter.ts`, `ToolActivationContext.ts`, `ToolRegistryBuilder.ts`. New ADR-0011 documents the OllamaClient injection pattern. Closes v0.7.0 known-gaps 2.3 + 2.4.
  - `marked` bumped to `^12.0.0` (resolved at 12.0.2) via `marked.parse(text, { async: false })`; the v12 Renderer API turned out to retain the v4 positional signature so the three custom renderers are unchanged-by-need. All 8 renderer tests green; sanitisation chain (CSP + DOMPurify) intact. Closes v0.7.0 known-gaps 2.1.
  - Mutation-testing gap fixes: new `tests/unit/guardrails/policy.test.ts` (18 assertions), `tests/unit/guardrails/ActionClassifier.coverage.test.ts` (113 parametric assertions), `tests/unit/tools/handlers/terminal.coverage.test.ts` (58 parametric assertions), `tests/unit/tools/handlers/filesystem.coverage.test.ts` (13 error-path assertions). `Orchestrator.test.ts` timing assertion rewritten `> 0` -> `>= 0` and re-included in `configs/stryker.config.json`. Closes v0.7.0 known-gaps 4.1-4.5.
- Live-Ollama baseline capture for the v0.5.0 retrospective `>= 40%` token-savings claim: in-process v0.7.0 baseline captured (see Added); the corresponding v0.4.0 + v0.6.0 live-Ollama captures remain operator-action, tracked in `docs/archive/versions/v0/v0.7.0/known-gaps.md`.
- Filesystem tool handler split (v0.6.0 plan sub-task 6.5) formally deferred to v0.8.0 with a documented cost/benefit decision (~25 import sites; file is functioning correctly today). See v0.7.0 known-gaps 2.2.

### Security

- The `compress` tool ships at permission tier 0 (auto-approve) by design: it operates on the in-process conversation transcript only and never touches the filesystem, network, or external state. No new auth surface. See [ADR-0012 Consequences](./docs/adr/0012-model-callable-compress-tool.md#consequences).
- v0.6.0 Phase 1 path-guard contract preserved: every filesystem tool handler still routes through `pathGuard.resolveInsideWorkspace`. The new memory file architecture writes only under `~/.gemma-code/memory/<workspace-id>/`, an out-of-workspace location; no new symlink-traversal surface introduced.
- `permissionOverrides` tier-floor clamp (v0.6.0 ADR-0007) preserved; the new `Yes-for-all` workspace persistence respects the same clamp.

### Explicitly NOT in v0.7.0

Policy-grounded drops from `docs/archive/versions/v0/v0.7.0/comparison-multi-source.md` Section 13:

- N1. Federation / cross-machine agent collaboration (S6 ruflo) -- violates offline-first thesis.
- N2. Multi-provider LLM routing (Claude / GPT / Gemini / Cohere) (S6 ruflo) -- local-only thesis.
- N3. Hosted web UI / Goal Planner front-end (S6 `flo.ruv.io`) -- local-only thesis.
- N4. Notion / Obsidian connectors (S2 Layer 3) -- third-party data processors.
- N5. Browser-extension surface (S3) -- Hard Constraint #1, no new product surface.
- N6. Cross-platform sandbox for yolo-mode (S1 CCO) -- CCO is Mac-only; Windows / Linux equivalents non-trivial.

Cross-version carryovers from v0.7.0 known-gaps Section 7 (scope-grounded deferrals, not policy drops):

- LSTM predictive caching (v0.5.0 architecture; v0.6.0 ADR-0009 closed the ARIMA prototype).
- Multi-provider LLM proxy (overlaps N2).
- Voice transcription.
- Distributed cache.
- `/memory prune --apply`, `/memory lint --apply` (read-side ships; write-side deferred).
- `format=json` on `read_file` and `run_terminal`.
- Severity-rubric CI gate that fails builds (currently informational).
- Streaming reads for files > 1 MB (current 1 MB pagination ceiling assumed sufficient).
- Auto-merge for Dependabot PRs.
- Rust performance components.
- Go CLI tooling for project scaffolding.
- ripgrep-backed `GrepCodebaseTool`.
- Extension Marketplace publication.
- Tree-sitter AST parsing.
- SSE transport for MCP server (current MCP transport is stdio only).

## [0.6.0] -- 2026-05-04

Hygiene and ratchet release. Closes the only chained P0 security finding from the v0.5.0 review pass, fixes the test pipeline that was masking failures, decomposes two god-class panel modules, removes four `BASELINE-2026-04-25` dependency-cruiser exceptions, and either wires or retracts every `documented-but-not-implemented` claim from v0.5.0. No new product surface beyond what the closure of those findings required. Five new ADRs (0006-0010) capture the material decisions.

### Added

- `gemma-code.mcpExposedTools: string[]` setting controls which tools the MCP server exposes to external peers. Defaults to read-only (`read_file`, `list_directory`, `grep_codebase`); operators can broaden but must opt in explicitly. Closes pen-test F-004's MCP-attack-surface leg.
- `gemma-code.ollamaEmbeddingThreshold` (default 0.85) and `gemma-code.heuristicEmbeddingThreshold` (default 0.95) settings expose the per-provenance cosine similarity bars applied by `searchByEmbedding`. See [ADR-0010](./docs/adr/0010-threshold-elevation-decision.md).
- `SubAgentSpawner` interface extracted from `SubAgentManager` to break the `SubAgentManager <-> SubAgentTool` circular import. Closes the `BASELINE-2026-04-25` exception for `agents -> tools/handlers/subAgent`.
- `MemoryShared.types.ts` extracted to break the `MemoryStore <-> MemoryConsolidator` circular import.
- `tests/unit/tools/handlers/filesystem-symlink.test.ts` -- regression test for ADR-0006. Exercises every filesystem tool against a workspace-internal symlink that resolves outside the root and asserts each refuses with a workspace-boundary error.
- `tests/integration/permission-overrides-clamp.test.ts` -- regression test for ADR-0007. Asserts CONFIRM/DANGEROUS-baseline tools cannot be auto-approved via `permissionOverrides`.
- `tests/integration/tool-output-cache-migration.test.ts` -- four-case idempotency test for the SQLite migration ladder (v0.4.0 -> v0.6.0 schema).
- `tests/integration/memory-consolidator-large.test.ts` -- 10K-event stress test for the `db.transaction`-wrapped consolidation pass; asserts wall-time below 5 s.
- `tests/unit/tools/handlers/pathGuard.test.ts` -- four mutation-survivor regression tests added during the Stryker pass (workspaceRoot null/empty, lexical fallback, absolute-out-of-root rejection).
- `tests/unit/storage/eviction/` -- per-strategy unit tests across the five `Evictor` implementations.
- `tests/golden/baselines/v0.6.0.json` (post-Phase-1 measurement; final regeneration scheduled against the post-Phase-7 build with live Ollama -- see [docs/archive/versions/v0/v0.6.0/development/history/2026-05_phase-8-release-gate.md](docs/archive/v0/v0.6/development/history/2026-05_phase-8-release-gate.md)).
- `tests/benchmarks/baselines/v0.6.0.json` (regeneration vs. v0.5.0 baseline scheduled per the same release-gate procedure).

### Changed

- All filesystem tool handlers (`read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `create_file`, `delete_file`, `list_directory`, `grep_codebase`) now route path resolution through `pathGuard.resolveInsideWorkspace`. The lexical `resolveWorkspacePath` helper is deleted; one realpath-aware guard for every tool. See [ADR-0006](./docs/adr/0006-unified-path-guard.md).
- `getPermissionTier()` clamps `permissionOverrides` so CONFIRM and DANGEROUS-baseline tools cannot be lowered to AUTO_APPROVE. A workspace-controlled `settings.json` that tries to silently auto-approve `run_terminal` or `delete_file` is neutralized at runtime with a deduped log warning. See [ADR-0007](./docs/adr/0007-permission-tier-floor.md).
- MCP-originated tool calls are tagged with `source: 'mcp'` and produce a peer-attributed confirmation prompt ("External MCP client wants to ...") distinct from local-agent and sub-agent prompts.
- `fetchWithSsrfGuard` enforces a 5 MB body cap on outbound HTTP responses (closes pen-test F-002).
- `ToolOutputCache._enforceCapacity()` is now true LRU. Added `accessed_at INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` column with backfill from `stored_at`; `lookup()` bumps `accessed_at` on every hit; eviction orders by `accessed_at ASC`. The original docstring claimed LRU; the SQL now matches. New hot-vs-cold regression test in `tests/unit/storage/ToolOutputCache.test.ts`.
- `searchByEmbedding` applies a per-row threshold based on `embedding_provenance`: `'heuristic'` rows must clear 0.95; `'ollama'` rows (and legacy NULL) clear 0.85. See [ADR-0010](./docs/adr/0010-threshold-elevation-decision.md).
- `GemmaCodePanel.ts` decomposed into four focused modules: `GemmaCodePanel.ts` (lifecycle + composition root), `ChatController.ts` (chat flow + memory injection), `ChatCommandHandlers.ts` (slash-command dispatch), `ChatWebviewHost.ts` (postMessage routing + webview surface lifecycle). The panel shrank from 1,724 to 935 lines. See [ADR-0008](./docs/adr/0008-panel-decomposition.md).
- `panels/webview/index.ts` source-level split into `scaffold.ts` (HTML composer + `formatModelName`), `styles.ts` (CSS), `bodyMarkup.ts` (HTML body), `runtime.ts` (inline IIFE). The original file shrank from 1,573 to 12 lines as a back-compat re-export shim. CSP, nonce, and `getWebviewHtml` callers unchanged.
- `secretPaths.ts` and `Compressor.ts` moved from `tools/handlers/` to `utils/` (utility shape, not handler shape; closes the `BASELINE-2026-04-25` exception for `tools -> chat`).
- `EmbeddingClient` consumes the abstract `LLMClient` port instead of `OllamaHttp` directly; `GemmaRuntime.getOllamaClient()` is the composition root for shared client construction. Closes the `BASELINE-2026-04-25` exception for `storage -> services`.
- `MemoryConsolidator.consolidate` is wrapped in `GraphMemory.transaction()`; a 10K-event stress run drops from tens of thousands of fsyncs to one transactional commit (~1.3 s wall time vs. multi-second pre-Phase-7).
- `npm audit` CI gate elevated from `--audit-level=high` to `--audit-level=moderate` for production dependencies. A new non-blocking `audit-ts-dev` job covers dev-deps with a 30-day artifact upload (does not gate merges).
- `cache-probe` fingerprint switched from MD5 to SHA-256 (closes pen-test F-005).
- New ESLint rule blocks `innerHTML` string concatenation in `src/panels/webview/runtime.ts`. Approved sinks use the existing DOMPurify-sanitised path. Closes pen-test F-006.
- Coverage CI gate now reads `coverage/coverage-summary.json` (`.total.lines.pct >= 80`, `.total.branches.pct >= 75`) instead of regex-scraping the lcov HTML report.
- `secretPaths` matcher swapped from a hand-rolled `globToRegex` compiler to `minimatch` with a per-glob cache. Five new edge-case tests (empty globs, brace expansion, backslash escape, exact-match, Windows separators) lock the behaviour parity.
- Documentation example webhook URLs in `docs/archive/versions/v0/v0.5.0/comparison/comparison-token-optimizer-mcp.md` obfuscated to `https://example.invalid/<redacted>` placeholders (closes pen-test F-011).
- `CompactionStrategy` interface is now `agents/-> chat/` rather than `chat/ -> agents/`, eliminating the directional baseline exception.

### Fixed

- 12 token-estimation tests in `tests/unit/chat/ContextCompactor.test.ts` rewritten as property-based tests against the `tiktoken` cross-check helper. The pre-existing failures inherited from v0.5.0 Phase 5 are gone (closes known-gaps 1.1).
- `tests/benchmarks/context-compaction.bench.ts` no longer imports the non-existent `createConversationManager` factory; instantiates `new ConversationManager("")` directly. Bench runs to completion.
- `src/config/GpuDetector.ts:18` -- explicit `void` return type on the `execWithTimeout` callback closes the pre-existing lint warning carried since v0.5.0.
- 3 architecture-doc inaccuracies corrected: meta-test path now points at `tests/unit/docs/AGENTS-md.test.ts`, v0.4.0 ship date corrected to `2026-04-25`, hand-written tool-permission-tier table replaced with a programmatically-generated marker block driven by `scripts/generate-tool-permission-table.mjs` and CI-gated via `npm run perm-tier:check`.
- FIFO-vs-LRU doc/code mismatch in `ToolOutputCache.prune()` reconciled (see Changed section).
- CI verifiably fails on test failures. Pre-v0.6.0, a vitest/Node 24 native-cleanup segfault during process teardown was masking exit codes; the `bench` npm script now passes `--run` so the bench process exits cleanly with the actual result.

### Removed

- Legacy `gemma-code.gpuTier` string setting removed. Use `gemma-code.gpuTierOverride: number | null` instead. The v0.5 migration shim that mapped legacy values is also gone; users with a stale `gpuTier` setting will see a one-time "unknown setting" warning.
- `PredictiveCache` module + `tests/unit/storage/PredictiveCache.test.ts` + `tests/unit/storage/PredictiveCache.budget.test.ts` + `tests/benchmarks/predictive-cache.bench.ts` deleted; `gemma-code.predictiveCacheEnabled` setting removed. Never wired into `ToolOutputCache.lookup()` or any runtime. See [ADR-0009](./docs/adr/0009-predictive-cache-decision.md).
- All four `BASELINE-2026-04-25; ratchet by v0.6.0` annotations removed from `configs/dependency-cruiser.cjs`. `npm run deps:check` reports zero violations across 121+ modules.

### Security

- Attack Path A closed at both legs: ADR-0006 closes the symlink leg by routing every filesystem tool through realpath-aware path resolution; ADR-0007 closes the auto-approve leg by clamping `permissionOverrides` so CONFIRM/DANGEROUS tools cannot drop to AUTO_APPROVE.
- Pen-test F-001 (split-brain path resolution), F-003 (permissionOverrides downgrade), F-004 (MCP peer attribution), F-002 (outbound HTTP body cap), F-005 (SHA-256 cache fingerprint), F-006 (innerHTML concatenation ESLint rule), F-007 (per-provenance threshold elevation), F-008 (PredictiveCache dead-code removal), F-011 (obfuscated example URLs) -- all closed.
- ESLint rule blocks `innerHTML` string concatenation in webview runtime; the only approved DOM sink remains the DOMPurify-sanitised path introduced in v0.4.0 Phase 1.

### Deferred to v0.7.0+

- `marked` v4 -> v12 migration (per Phase 7 sub-task 7.5 conditional escape; v12 reshapes the `Renderer` API and is non-trivial; DOMPurify already provides the sanitisation layer that was the original rationale).
- Filesystem tool handler split (Phase 6 sub-task 6.5 deferred per the plan's "lower-priority" note).
- Hoisting agent-loop / pipeline / orchestrator construction into `ChatController` (full ownership split per ADR-0008's neutral consequence).
- LSTM predictive caching, multi-provider LLM proxy, voice transcription, distributed cache, `/memory prune --apply`, `format=json` on `read_file` / `run_terminal`, severity-rubric CI gate that fails builds, streaming reads for files > 1 MB, auto-merge for Dependabot.

### v0.5.0 retrospective note

The v0.5.0 plan stated a target of `>=40% average tool-output token reduction vs. v0.4.0`. This claim never appeared in the v0.5.0 CHANGELOG entry below; it lived in `docs/archive/versions/v0/v0.5.0/plans/implementation-plan.md` and the Phase 12 history. The measured number was deferred at v0.5.0 ship time (`tests/golden/baselines/v0.4.0.json` was not captured). v0.6.0 captures `v0.6.0.json` against live Ollama as part of the release-gate procedure documented in `docs/archive/versions/v0/v0.6.0/development/history/2026-05_phase-8-release-gate.md`; the long-arc compare against `v0.4.0.json` is logged as the first action of the post-cycle measurement window. The `>=40%` figure remains a *target*, not a verified shipping claim, until the comparison run lands.

## [0.5.0] -- 2026-04-26

Unified adoption release. Combines five comparison-driven adoption plans (token-optimizer-mcp, agent-friendly-CLIs, routa-harness, free-claude-code, foundry-vault) into a coherent dozen-phase roadmap. The product surface stays the same (offline VS Code extension on top of Gemma 4 via Ollama); the changes are inside the harness, the tool catalogue, the cache stack, and the operational hygiene.

### Phase 1 -- Identity and Naming

- AGENTS.md adopted as the sole canonical directive; no CLAUDE.md anywhere in the repo
- Test-pyramid taxonomy split into "smoke" / "regression" / "scenario" with the rubric in [docs/archive/versions/v0/v0.5.0/test-pyramid.md](docs/archive/v0/v0.5/test-pyramid.md)
- Generic naming convention applied across product files (no provider branding)

### Phase 2 -- Tool Surface Hardening

- Universal 64 KB byte-cap on every tool output via `OutputRedirector` with a structured truncation hint pointing at narrow-down parameters
- `read_file(range_start, range_end)` pagination (1 MB max window; EOF marker on short reads)
- `grep_codebase(max_results, next_offset)` pagination with opaque base64-encoded cursor; default 50 / max 500
- Per-call `max_bytes` override (per-tool ceiling 1 MB)
- `tool_output.truncated` metric on `MetricsCollector` for cap-fire calibration

### Phase 3 -- Compression Foundation

- Brotli-backed `Compressor` for cache and transcript payloads
- Round-trip fidelity tests for ASCII / emoji / CJK / JSON / binary fixtures
- Transcript integration: tool outputs > 12 KB serialize to disk compressed

### Phase 4 -- Persistent Cache + Diff-Based Reads

- `ToolOutputCache` (SQLite, chmod 0o600) keyed by `(absolute_path, mtime_ms, size_bytes)`
- In-process LRU front (50 entries / 1 MB) for within-session re-reads
- Diff-based read on cache hit when on-disk file changed
- Secret-path denylist applied on every `store()`
- `/cache status|clear|prune` slash command surface

### Phase 5 -- Semantic Recall + Precise Budgeting

- tiktoken-backed budgeting on prompt construction (replaces character-count heuristic)
- Embedding column on `tool_output_cache` rows; cosine search via `searchByEmbedding`
- FTS5 keyword fallback when Ollama is offline; `excerpt` column backfilled by migration
- Default semantic threshold 0.85; sub-task `searchByKeyword` fallback path

### Phase 6 -- Mutation Safety + Structured Outputs

- `run_terminal(dry_run=true)` returns token list + allowlist verdict without spawning
- `delete_file(dry_run=true)` returns size + SHA-256 (first 1 MB) without unlinking
- `list_directory(format='json')` and `grep_codebase(format='json')` return RFC-8259 JSON; truncated form remains valid JSON
- Adversarial property-based test confirms `child_process.spawn` and `fs.unlinkSync` are never called on dry-run

### Phase 7 -- Memory Hygiene + N-Corroboration

- `MemoryConsolidator` enforces N >= 2 corroboration before promoting an observation to a fact (default `gemma-code.memoryCorroborationThreshold = 2`; setting to 1 restores legacy behavior)
- Migration backfills `corroboration_count = 1` on every existing row
- `/memory lint` produces a parseable health report (counts, candidate rows, top corroborated)
- New missed-fact golden eval `memory-hygiene-missed-fact-01` proves single-source candidates are not blindly trusted

### Phase 8 -- Generic Harness + Specialist Externalization

- Three generic Node ESM hook scripts under `scripts/hooks/` (`check-commit-msg.mjs`, `check-prompt-policy.mjs`, `check-tool-permission.mjs`); harness-agnostic by design
- Sub-agent prompts externalized to `assets/specialists/*.md` and resolved through a priority chain (`<workspace>/.gemma-code/specialists/` overrides workspace, which overrides committed defaults)
- No `.claude/` directory committed to the repository
- Characterization tests prove behavior preservation against the pre-Phase-8 inline prompts

### Phase 9 -- Coverage and Observability

- `tests/benchmarks/` covers `tool-execution`, `context-compaction`, `cache-hit`, `hooks` with p50/p99 captures
- Nightly benchmark regression gate via `scripts/check-bench-regressions.mjs` against committed baselines
- `scripts/build-vsix.ps1` smoke-tests the packaged VSIX before tagging

### Phase 10 -- Local Development Hygiene + CI Hardening

- husky pre-commit (`lint-staged`) + commit-msg (ASCII-only enforcement) wired
- ESLint blocks un-justified `@ts-ignore` (allow-with-description, 20-char min)
- All GitHub Actions pinned to commit SHAs (40-char hex, version-tag preserved as a comment)
- `concurrency: cancel-in-progress` on long-running workflows
- CI matrix expanded to Node 18, 20, 22

### Phase 11 -- Documentation Discipline

- 4 new ADRs landed: 0002 memory subsystem layering, 0003 compaction strategy ordering, 0004 sub-agent isolation contract, 0005 tool permission tiers
- Mermaid module-dependency diagram in [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Module Authorship Contract in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)
- [docs/refactor-playbook.md](./docs/refactor-playbook.md) published; cross-referenced from CONTRIBUTING.md
- [docs/index.md](./docs/index.md) auto-generated by `scripts/generate-catalog.mjs`; CI gate via `npm run catalog:check`

### Phase 12 -- Advanced Fallbacks + Release Gate

**Eviction strategies (`src/storage/eviction/`)**
- New pluggable `Evictor` interface with five pure-JS strategies: `LRUEvictor` (default; preserves v0.4.0 behavior), `LFUEvictor`, `ARCEvictor` (adaptive recency/frequency split), `WTinyLFUEvictor` (window LRU + count-min sketch admission), `ClockEvictor` (second-chance approximation)
- Selectable via `gemma-code.cacheEvictionStrategy` (default `lru`)
- `ToolOutputLru` threads the strategy through `onAccess` / `onInsert` / `onRemove` / `pickVictim` so the storage Map and the policy stay decoupled
- Per-strategy unit tests under `tests/unit/storage/eviction/`

**Predictive cache (`src/storage/PredictiveCache.ts`)**
- Pure-JS ARIMA(1,0,1) forecaster fit by gradient descent; ~80 LOC core
- Tracks per-path access timestamps (max 256 paths, 64 samples each)
- `predict(topK)` ranks paths by inverse predicted-arrival-delta, weighted by residual variance
- LSTM is **explicitly out of scope** -- not a model, not a toggle, not a future flag
- Off by default; opt-in via `gemma-code.predictiveCacheEnabled`

**Heuristic embedder fallback (`src/storage/HeuristicEmbedder.ts`)**
- Deterministic 128-D embedding from hash features (21 dims) + statistical features (43 dims) + n-gram presence over a 64-token vocabulary (64 dims)
- L2-normalised; pure JS; no model file
- Wired into `EmbeddingClient.embedWithProvenance` -- callers receive `{ embedding, provenance: 'ollama' | 'heuristic' }`
- `tool_output_cache.embedding_provenance` column added (migration); rows tagged `'heuristic'` are upgradable
- New `/cache reembed` slash command walks heuristic-tagged rows and re-embeds them via Ollama once the model is back online

**Truncation-recovery golden micro-eval**
- 3 new golden tasks under `tests/golden/tasks/agent-friendly-*.yaml`
  - `agent-friendly-truncation-recovery-read-01` -- `read_file(range_start, range_end)` past the 64 KB cap
  - `agent-friendly-truncation-recovery-grep-02` -- `grep_codebase(next_offset)` paging through > 200 matches
  - `agent-friendly-dry-run-then-execute-03` -- `delete_file(dry_run=true)` before the destructive call
- Snapshots include deterministic `_setup.mjs` generators so fixtures stay reproducible
- Baseline at [tests/golden/baselines/v0.5.0+agent-friendly.json](./tests/golden/baselines/v0.5.0+agent-friendly.json)

**semantic-release + commitlint**
- [commitlint.config.cjs](./commitlint.config.cjs) extending `@commitlint/config-conventional` (allowed types: feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, test, ci, build, perf, revert, style)
- [.releaserc.json](./.releaserc.json) plugin chain: `commit-analyzer -> release-notes-generator -> changelog -> git -> github` (deliberately no `@semantic-release/npm` because Gemma is a VSIX, not an npm package)
- New workflows: [.github/workflows/commitlint.yml](./.github/workflows/commitlint.yml) (PR commits) and [.github/workflows/semantic-release.yml](./.github/workflows/semantic-release.yml) (push to main)
- New devDependencies: `@commitlint/cli`, `@commitlint/config-conventional`, `@semantic-release/changelog`, `@semantic-release/git`, `@semantic-release/github`, `semantic-release`

**Release artifacts**
- `package.json` version bumped to 0.5.0
- This CHANGELOG entry
- [docs/archive/versions/v0/v0.5.0/architecture.md](docs/archive/v0/v0.5/architecture.md) describing the v0.5.0 architecture
- v0.5.0 git tag prepared (push deferred to explicit user confirmation)

### Deferred / Out of Scope

The following are recorded for v0.6.0+: LSTM predictive caching (hard constraint), multi-provider LLM proxy, voice transcription, distributed cache, `/memory prune` and `/memory lint --apply`, auto-merge for Dependabot, `format=json` on `read_file` and `run_terminal`. See [docs/archive/versions/v0/v0.5.0/plans/implementation-plan.md](docs/archive/v0/v0.5/plans/implementation-plan.md) "Out of Scope" section for the full table.

## [0.4.0] -- 2026-04-25

Code-review remediation release closing all 14 P0 findings from the v0.3.0 review.

### Phase 1 -- Critical Hotfix (P0 Unblock)

**Correctness**
- ChatHistoryStore FTS5 index stays in sync on message re-saves (added AFTER UPDATE trigger; switched saveMessage from INSERT OR REPLACE to explicit UPDATE/INSERT so the trigger fires)
- TaskDAG.hasCycle() no longer contains a dead in-degree loop; edge-direction intent is documented inline
- GraphQueryEngine.explainPath returns all intermediate entities on multi-hop paths (GraphMemory.getEntityById promoted to public)

**Security**
- run_terminal rejects any cwd that resolves outside the workspace root (shared path guard in src/tools/handlers/pathGuard.ts; symlink-aware)

**Security**
- Webview HTML rendered from LLM/tool/memory content is now sanitized through DOMPurify before reaching any innerHTML sink (strips <script>, <iframe>, <style>, inline event handlers, javascript: URIs)
- Content-Security-Policy tightened in both chat and trace-dashboard webviews: img-src, connect-src, object-src, frame-src, base-uri, form-action explicitly denied; require-trusted-types-for 'script' added
- run_terminal rejects any cwd that resolves outside the workspace root via a new shared src/tools/handlers/pathGuard.ts (symlink-aware)
- SessionListPanel HTML template now escapes session ids in attribute contexts (also gates finding #87)

**Performance**
- MemoryStore.searchSemantic scales with an FTS5 candidate pre-filter (bounded at 200 rows) and a per-instance Float32 embedding cache invalidated on save/prune/clear (previously full-table scan + Float64 per call)
- Tracer writes are batched: startSpan/endSpan buffer in memory and flush in a single transaction every 32 ops or on process.nextTick; endSpan no longer issues a per-span SELECT (startTime + attributes kept in-memory); reads auto-flush for consistency

**Testing**
- McpToolHandler unit tests (delegation, error propagation, rejection bubbling, argument pass-through)
- SessionListPanel unit tests (HTML rendering, message handling, escapeAttr wiring, null-store safety)
- MarkdownRenderer XSS regression tests (8 cases covering <script>/<iframe>/javascript:/<style>/<details open ontoggle>/inline event handlers)
- MemorySubsystem unit tests (disabled() contract, wired layers, graph-engine binding, isReady semantics)
- TraceStore batching tests (flushed queryability, in-memory endSpan path, implicit flush on read)
- Integration test for the safety pipeline: classifier -> requiresCheckpoint -> GitSafetyNet.createCheckpoint/rollback wired with real classifier + GitSafetyNet and mocked execFile (tests/integration/safety/agent-safety-pipeline.test.ts)

**CI**
- Benchmark regression gate: nightly.yml now exports bench results as JSON and runs scripts/check-bench-regressions.mjs against tests/benchmarks/baselines/v0.3.0.json; fails on >20% hz regression. First post-merge nightly will populate the baseline via --update-baseline mode.
- Golden task live-Ollama job: golden-tasks.yml now matrixes e2b + e4b, pulls Gemma, runs tests/golden/framework/run_all.py against OLLAMA_URL, diffs against v0.3.0 baseline, and uploads a Markdown regression report.

**Restructuring**
- Python FastAPI backend removed (ADR-0001). src/backend/ tree deleted along with BackendManager wiring, lint-py / test-py CI jobs, integration-py nightly job, and the installer venv step. The extension now talks directly to Ollama.
- `gemma-code.useBackend`, `gemma-code.backendPort`, `gemma-code.pythonPath` settings removed. Users with these set in their workspace will see "unknown setting" warnings on upgrade; they are safe to delete.
- GemmaCodePanel memory wiring extracted into src/storage/MemorySubsystem.ts (first slice of the god-object split). GemmaCodePanel.ts shrank by ~84 lines; the factory is independently unit-tested.

**Release**
- package.json version bumped to 0.4.0
- modelName default aligned across package.json manifest and src/config/settings.ts (both now "gemma4:e4b")

### Phase 7 -- Simplification and Release

**Removed (~800 LOC)**
- BudgetEnforcer (`src/guardrails/BudgetEnforcer.ts`) and its test; agent-loop branches that consumed it were already removed in Phase 3
- LazyToolLoader (`src/tools/LazyToolLoader.ts`), the `serializeToolSummary` helper in `Gemma4ToolFormat.ts`, the `lazyToolLoading` flag on `PromptContext`, and the `get_tool_schema` meta-tool from the catalog/permission tiers
- ConversationSync (`src/storage/ConversationSync.ts`) and its test
- RelevanceScorer (`src/chat/RelevanceScorer.ts`), its test, and the async relevance branch in `PromptBuilder.build` (build is now synchronous; all call sites updated)
- GpuTierConfig (`src/config/GpuTierConfig.ts`) and `inferTierFromModelName`; tier model unified onto `HardwareTierConfig` (gains `subAgentMaxIterations` + `maxConcurrentSubAgents`); `Orchestrator` and `DAGExecutor` now consume `HardwareTierConfig` directly
- `gemma-code.gpuTier` setting (with v0.5 migration shim that maps the legacy "1"/"2"/"3" string onto the canonical `gpuTierOverride` numeric tier)
- `gemma-code.memoryAutoSaveInterval` setting (no readers remained)
- `gemma-code.maxSessionTokens` and `gemma-code.maxSessionMinutes` settings (tied to BudgetEnforcer deletion)
- `escapeAttr` alias in MarkdownRenderer (every call site now invokes `escapeHtml` directly)
- `highlight.min.js` copy step in `scripts/build-vsix.ps1` (webview imports highlight.js via the bundled module loader; ~1 MB smaller VSIX)
- `validateExpectation` and `detectRegressions` relocated from `src/evaluation/GoldenTaskSuite.ts` to `tests/helpers/goldenTaskHelpers.ts` (test-only consumers)

**Wired**
- `gemma-code.permissionOverrides` setting now reaches `ToolRegistry.setConfirmationGate` so user overrides take effect (previously read but never applied); covered by a new `ToolRegistry` unit test

**Internal**
- `tsconfig.json`: `declaration: false`, `declarationMap: false` (no `.d.ts` artifacts in `out/`; faster builds)
- `parseOtlpHeaders` rewritten as `split` -> `map` -> `Object.fromEntries` (same shape, half the lines)

## [0.3.0] -- 2026-04-18

Cross-platform installer, golden task evaluation suite, and integration stabilization.

### Added

**Phase 7 -- Cross-Platform PyQt5 Installer**
- PyQt5 wizard installer replacing Windows-only NSIS installer
- 9-step installation wizard: Welcome, Prerequisites, GPU Detection, Install Path, Model Selection, Configuration, Review, Installing, Complete
- Automatic GPU detection (NVIDIA, AMD, Apple Silicon, Intel) with model recommendation
- Platform-specific installation: Windows (.exe), macOS (.dmg), Linux (AppImage)
- Real-time log panel during installation with color-coded output
- Headless mode (`--headless`, `--model`, `--install-path`, `--skip-model`, `--json-output`) for CI/automated installations
- "Open VS Code" button on completion page

**Phase 8 -- Golden Task Suite & Integration Stabilization**
- Golden task evaluation framework with YAML-based task definitions
- 24 golden tasks across 5 categories: multi-file edits (5), bug fixes (5), refactors (5), test generation (5), code review (4)
- Per-model-tier benchmark suite (E2B, E4B, 26B, 31B) measuring TTFT p50/p99 and throughput
- Memory recall accuracy benchmarks (keyword and semantic search) with latency targets
- Regression detection with baseline comparison (pass/fail flips, time, tokens, iterations, pass-rate drop)
- Cross-platform installer smoke tests (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- End-to-end integration tests for core v0.2.0 + v0.3.0 composition (full mocks)
- v0.2.0 vs v0.3.0 performance comparison framework

### Changed

- Installer technology changed from NSIS (Windows-only) to PyQt5 (cross-platform)
- Old NSIS installer preserved under `scripts/installer/legacy/`

### Known Limitations

- macOS .dmg is not notarized (requires Apple Developer account)
- Linux AppImage requires FUSE to run on some distributions
- Golden tasks require a running Ollama instance; CI uses E2B on CPU which is slower
- GPU detection may not work in virtualized environments (CI runners)

## [0.2.0] -- 2026-04-10

Major architectural evolution: Gemma 4 native protocol, dynamic prompt engineering, persistent cross-session memory, multi-strategy compaction, MCP interoperability, and sub-agent orchestration.

### Added

**Phase 0 -- Gemma 4 Native Protocol**
- Gemma 4 native tool calling via `<|tool_call>`, `<|tool_result>`, `<|tool>` tokens (replaces custom XML `<tool_call>` protocol)
- Gemma 4 native system role via `<|turn>system` token (removes Gemma 3 system-to-user workaround)
- Thinking mode via `<|think|>` token for chain-of-thought reasoning
- `Gemma4ToolFormat` parser with `<|"|>` string delimiter handling and code fence exclusion

**Phase 1 -- Dynamic PromptBuilder**
- `PromptBuilder` class assembling system prompt sections conditionally within a token budget
- Section-based architecture with priority ordering and greedy packing (always-include sections first, then conditional by ascending priority)
- `PromptBudget` calculator: system 10%, memory 3%, skills 2%, conversation 65%, response 20%
- `promptStyle` setting: `concise` (default), `detailed`, or `beginner`
- `systemPromptBudgetPercent` setting for custom budget tuning

**Phase 2 -- Multi-Strategy Context Compaction**
- 5-strategy compaction pipeline applied in cost order (cheapest first):
  1. ToolResultClearing -- strip old `<|tool_result>` blocks, keep N most recent
  2. SlidingWindow -- drop middle messages, preserve first + last N + summaries
  3. CodeBlockTruncation -- replace large code blocks (>80 lines) with placeholders
  4. LlmSummary -- structured summary preserving file paths, decisions, errors
  5. EmergencyTrim -- hard clip as last resort
- Pre-compaction hook for memory extraction before lossy operations
- `compactionKeepRecent` and `compactionToolResultsKeep` settings

**Phase 3 -- Persistent Memory System**
- SQLite FTS5 keyword search for cross-session memory (zero new dependencies)
- Optional Ollama embeddings (`nomic-embed-text`) for semantic search
- 5 memory types: decision, fact, preference, file_pattern, error_resolution
- Auto-extraction of memories during compaction via pre-compaction hooks
- Token-budgeted memory injection into system prompt (3% of context window)
- `/memory` slash command with search, save, clear, and status subcommands
- `memoryEnabled`, `embeddingModel`, `memoryAutoSaveInterval`, `memoryMaxEntries` settings

**Phase 4 -- Conditional Tool Activation and MCP**
- Context-dependent tool enable/disable via `ToolActivationRules`
- 15-tool cap for reliable Gemma 4 tool calling; lowest-priority tools dropped when exceeded
- Activation rules: Ollama reachability, network availability, read-only sessions, sub-agent type
- MCP client: connect to external MCP servers, discover and register tools
- MCP server: expose Gemma Code tools via stdio protocol (opt-in)
- `McpManager` lifecycle management with config from `~/.gemma-code/mcp.json`
- `/mcp` slash command with status, connect, and disconnect subcommands
- `mcpEnabled` and `mcpServerMode` settings

**Phase 5 -- Sub-Agent Orchestration**
- Verification sub-agent: auto-triggers after 3+ file edits (configurable), reviews changes for bugs, runs relevant tests
- Research sub-agent: gathers information using read-only tools + web search; triggered via `/research <query>`
- Planning sub-agent: decomposes complex tasks into numbered implementation steps
- Isolated execution: each sub-agent gets its own ConversationManager, AgentLoop, and ToolRegistry with scoped tools
- Sub-agent results injected into main conversation as advisory messages
- `/verify` and `/research` slash commands for manual sub-agent triggering
- `verificationEnabled`, `verificationThreshold`, `subAgentMaxIterations` settings
- Webview status banner with spinner showing active sub-agent type

**Phase 6 -- Integration and Documentation**
- Python backend aligned with multi-strategy compaction (tool-result clearing + sliding window)
- Python backend accepts dynamic `system_prompt` parameter
- Webview UI indicators for memory status, MCP connection, sub-agent progress, and thinking mode
- `SECURITY.md` with vulnerability disclosure policy (48h ack, 7-day critical fix)
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` root-level architecture overview
- Full architecture documentation at `docs/archive/versions/v0/v0.2.0/architecture.md`

### Changed

- Default model changed from `gemma4` to `gemma4:e4b` (explicit variant selection)
- Default `maxTokens` increased from 32768 to 131072 (Gemma 4 E4B 128K context)
- Default `temperature` changed from 0.2 to 1.0 (Gemma 4 recommended sampling)
- Added `topP` (0.95) and `topK` (64) sampling parameters (Gemma 4 recommended)
- Tool protocol migrated from custom XML to Gemma 4 native tokens
- System prompt changed from static constant to dynamic `PromptBuilder` assembly
- Context compaction upgraded from single LLM summary to 5-strategy pipeline
- Python backend `prompt.py` updated for Gemma 4 turn tokens and dynamic system prompt parameter
- Fixed bug in Python backend where `request_timeout` was passed as `max_tokens`

### Known Limitations

- MCP support is experimental; only stdio transport is implemented
- Sub-agents run sequentially on a single GPU; each sub-agent adds 10-30 seconds of latency
- Semantic memory search requires pulling `nomic-embed-text` (274 MB); falls back to keyword-only search without it
- E2B model variant may not reliably follow complex agentic instructions; sub-agents are most effective on E4B or larger
- macOS and Linux installer scripts are still not implemented

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-07

First stable release of Gemma Code — a fully offline, agentic coding assistant for VS Code powered by Google's Gemma 4 via Ollama.

### Added

**Phase 1 — Extension Skeleton & Ollama Client**
- VS Code extension scaffold with TypeScript, tsconfig, ESLint, and Vitest
- `OllamaClient` with streaming chat support (`streamChat`), health check (`checkHealth`), and model listing (`listModels`)
- Extension activation/deactivation lifecycle with an Output channel ("Gemma Code")
- `gemma-code.ping` command for verifying Ollama connectivity
- Unit tests for the Ollama client; integration smoke test for live Ollama health checks

**Phase 2 — Chat Engine & Streaming UI**
- `ConversationManager` maintaining ordered message history with token-count trimming and `onDidChange` events
- Webview chat panel (`GemmaCodePanel`) registered as a VS Code sidebar view
- Bidirectional postMessage protocol between extension host and webview
- Streaming token pipeline: each Ollama chunk is relayed to the webview in real time
- Vanilla TypeScript webview UI with streaming bubbles, Shift+Enter newlines, and auto-scroll
- Retry on stream failure within the first 3 tokens

**Phase 3 — Agentic Tool Layer**
- Tool-call protocol: model emits `<tool_call>` XML blocks; extension parses, executes, and injects `<tool_result>` messages
- Tool handlers: `read_file`, `write_file`, `create_file`, `delete_file`, `edit_file`, `list_directory`, `grep_codebase`, `run_terminal`, `web_search`, `fetch_page`
- Path traversal protection on all file system tools (workspace-root boundary check)
- `ConfirmationGate` for user-approved tool execution (edit and terminal)
- `AgentLoop` with configurable `maxAgentIterations` (default 20) and stop-signal on overflow
- Tool progress indicators in the webview ("Using tool: …")
- Web search via DuckDuckGo HTML endpoint (no API key required)

**Phase 4 — Skills, Commands & DevAI-Hub Integration**
- `SkillLoader` parsing SKILL.md frontmatter; hot-reloads from `~/.gemma-code/skills/`
- Built-in skill catalog: `commit`, `review-pr`, `generate-readme`, `generate-changelog`, `generate-tests`, `analyze-codebase`, `setup-project`
- `CommandRouter` parsing slash commands and routing to built-in handlers or skill executor
- Built-in commands: `/help`, `/clear`, `/history`, `/plan`, `/compact`, `/model`
- Inline autocomplete popup for slash commands in the webview chat input
- `PlanMode` with numbered-plan detection heuristic and step-by-step approval workflow

**Phase 5 — Advanced UX Features**
- SQLite-backed chat history (`ChatHistoryStore`) with session create/save/list/search/delete
- `/history` command showing past sessions; click to resume
- `ContextCompactor` with 80%-threshold auto-compact and `/compact` command
- Token count indicator in the webview header (X / Y tokens, colour-coded)
- Three edit modes: Auto, Ask (diff editor + confirmation), Manual (display only)
- Edit mode selector in the webview header
- Markdown rendering with `marked` and syntax highlighting with `highlight.js` (both bundled, no CDN)
- Code block "Copy" button and collapsible tool-result blocks
- Incremental streaming render: raw text during stream, full Markdown after completion

**Phase 6 — Python Backend & Inference Optimisation**
- FastAPI backend (`src/backend/`) with `/health`, `/models`, and `/chat/stream` (SSE) endpoints
- Gemma chat template formatting (`<start_of_turn>user … <end_of_turn>`) applied server-side
- `BackendManager` in TypeScript: auto-starts the Python process on activation, falls back to direct Ollama on failure
- `gemma-code.useBackend`, `gemma-code.backendPort`, and `gemma-code.pythonPath` settings

**Phase 7 — Installer & Distribution**
- VSIX build pipeline (`scripts/build-vsix.ps1`) producing `gemma-code-0.1.0.vsix`
- NSIS installer script (`scripts/installer/setup.nsi`) for Windows 10/11
  - Installs Ollama silently if not present
  - Installs the VSIX via `code --install-extension`
  - Sets up a Python virtual environment for the backend
  - Optional Gemma model download with progress display
  - Adds Start Menu shortcut and Add/Remove Programs entry
  - Uninstaller removes the venv and VS Code extension
- GitHub Actions workflows: `ci.yml` (lint + test + coverage gate), `release.yml` (VSIX + installer + GitHub Release), `nightly.yml` (integration tests + benchmarks)
- CI documentation in `docs/archive/versions/v0/v0.1.0/ci-setup.md`
- E2E smoke test verifying the extension loads in VS Code without a running Ollama instance

**Phase 8 — Hardening, CI/CD & Release**
- Global `unhandledRejection` handler in `extension.ts` — logs to the Output channel instead of crashing the extension host
- Ollama availability poller: polls every 5 seconds; posts a recovery notification when Ollama comes back online; posts an error banner when it goes offline
- Startup health check with actionable error messaging and a "Pull model" quick action
- SSRF protection in `FetchPageTool`: rejects localhost, loopback, link-local, and all RFC-1918 private IP ranges; blocks non-HTTP(S) schemes
- Terminal blocklist hardening: blocklist now checks every shell-metacharacter-separated segment to prevent chain-bypass attacks
- `GemmaCodePanel.postStatus()` and `postError()` public methods for external error signalling
- Python backend crash detection with VS Code notification and graceful fallback to direct Ollama
- Performance benchmark suite: `time-to-first-token`, `context-compaction`, `tool-execution`, `skill-loading`, `markdown-rendering` — all integrated into nightly CI
- Security audit documentation (`docs/archive/versions/v0/v0.1.0/security-audit.md`) with findings and remediations
- Performance benchmark documentation (`docs/archive/versions/v0/v0.1.0/performance-benchmarks.md`)
- Architecture documentation (`docs/archive/versions/v0/v0.1.0/architecture.md`) with component descriptions and data-flow diagrams
- Comprehensive README with installation guide, quick start, configuration reference, and troubleshooting section
- Error regression tests in `tests/unit/errors/`

### Changed

- Default model switched from `gemma3:27b` to `gemma4` (Gemma 4 e4b, 128K context, native function calling)
- Default `maxTokens` increased from 8192 to 32768 to take advantage of Gemma 4's larger context window
- Ollama requests now pass `num_ctx` and `temperature` options to the server for consistent context handling
- Nightly CI uses `gemma4:e2b` (smallest Gemma 4 variant) instead of `gemma3:2b`
- Windows installer model download updated to `gemma4` (~9.6 GB, down from ~15 GB for gemma3:27b)
- Removed duplicate `configs/eslint.config.mjs` (dead file; canonical ESLint config is at project root)

### Known Limitations

- The Rust performance components and Go CLI tooling described in the tech stack are placeholders for future phases; v0.1.0 uses TypeScript and Python only.
- The GrepCodebaseTool uses VS Code's `workspace.findFiles` API and may be slow on very large repositories (>10 000 files). A ripgrep-based implementation is planned.
- The web search tool fetches DuckDuckGo's HTML endpoint; result quality varies and the endpoint is rate-limited by IP.
- macOS and Linux installer scripts are not yet implemented; manual VSIX installation is required on non-Windows platforms.
- The E2E test suite requires a VS Code instance and is not run in the standard CI matrix; it runs manually or in the nightly workflow.

"""
v1.0.0 Phase 6.1 -- Python diffusion sidecar entry point.

The Tauri shell spawns this script alongside the Node sidecar. It speaks
line-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdin/stdout (one request per line, one
response per line). Keeping the wire format identical to the Node sidecar
means the Rust core can drive both processes through the same `request()`
helper.

PyTorch + diffusers are imported lazily on first job dispatch so the
sidecar boots in environments that only need `health` and `version`
(CI, smoke tests, smoke acceptance tests on machines without CUDA).
The `pipelines/` package keeps each pipeline implementation isolated so
the import cost is paid once per pipeline kind.

/**
 * v2.2.0 Phase 4 (4.1) -- single-GPU model-switch policy.
 *
 * The decision layer between "the user did something that needs a model" and
 * the GpuScheduler. It exists because a consumer GPU holds one model at a
 * time, and the two obvious designs are both wrong:
 *
 *   - Switch silently whenever a surface asks. A stray click on Image Studio
 *     then evicts the model an agentic task is mid-way through using.
 *   - Ask every time. Every cross-modality step turns into a dialog, which
 *     makes agentic automation unusable.
 *
 * So the policy classifies each request instead. Tab navigation never reaches
 * here at all (see `assertNoLoadOnNavigation` and its test): only an actual
 * submit or an agentic tool call does.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-light, like `modelSwap.ts` beside it: no scheduler
 * reference, no telemetry bus, no I/O. Callers feed it a snapshot and act on
 * the verdict, which makes the whole decision matrix unit-testable.
 *
 * Boundary: core/** (no modules/**).

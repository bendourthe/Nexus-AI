/**
 * v1.1.0 Phase 5.4 -- Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).
 *
 * Reference: Cormack, Clarke, Buettcher, "Reciprocal Rank Fusion outperforms
 * Condorcet and individual rank learning methods" (SIGIR 2009). The fused
 * score for an entry `e` is `sum_over_rankings(1 / (k + rank_i(e)))`, where
 * `rank_i(e)` is its 1-based position in ranking `i`. Entries absent from
 * a ranking contribute nothing from that ranking.
 *
 * The default `k = 60` matches the paper's canonical value and the
 * SettingsStore key `nexus.memory.rrf.k`. Lower `k` boosts top-of-list
 * confidence; higher `k` smooths between rankings.
 *
 * Input format: each ranking is a `Map<entryId, score>` whose insertion
 * order encodes the ranking position. Callers that produce score-sorted
 * arrays should build the map by iterating descending-score-first so the
 * 1st-inserted key is rank 1. (Maps preserve insertion order in JS by
 * spec.)
 *
 * Adopts agentmemory A1 (see docs/archive/v1/v1.1/comparison-agentmemory.md
 * Section 11.2 P1).

/**
 * v1.15.0 Phase 7 (Issue 6) -- degraded ("safe mode") activation fallback.
 *
 * The reported failure was that clicking the Nexus icon reported
 * `command 'nexus.coding.newChat' not found` while the Chat / Memory / Traces
 * views span forever. Both symptoms had one cause: `activate()` threw before the
 * commands and webview providers were registered (the engine graph eagerly loads
 * the `better-sqlite3` native module, and an Electron ABI mismatch or a failing
 * subsystem constructor aborted activation part-way).
 *
 * This module guarantees a usable surface no matter what the engine does: every
 * declared command id and every declared view id gets a registration that
 * explains the degraded state instead of silently not existing. It only fills
 * gaps -- `registerFallbacks` skips ids that already registered successfully,
 * so a healthy activation is untouched.

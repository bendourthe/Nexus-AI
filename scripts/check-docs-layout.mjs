/**
 * v1.10.0 Phase 8 (T048) -- docs-layout consistency gate.
 *
 * The docs tree was canonicalized to the version-first scheme in v1.10.0:
 *   active:  docs/v<MAJOR>/v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>/...
 *   archive: docs/archive/v<MAJOR>/v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>/...
 * dropping the legacy `docs/versions/` and `docs/archive/versions/` wrappers.
 *
 * This gate fails if either retired wrapper directory reappears on disk, so the
 * canonical layout cannot silently regress. It checks the on-disk structure
 * (the real invariant, "no docs/versions/** paths remain"), not file contents:
 * historical prose and frozen archived docs legitimately still mention the old
 * scheme by name, and link rot predating this refactor is out of scope.

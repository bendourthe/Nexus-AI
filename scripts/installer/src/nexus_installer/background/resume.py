"""Crash detection + resume/restart decision (v1.11.0 Phase 7, T704).

Pure, Qt-free logic. On the next launch we hold a (possibly stale) persisted
:class:`InstallState` and a single fact from the reattach layer: is a primary
process still alive? From those two inputs this module decides what the launch
should do, and -- when a crashed run is resumable -- which steps are already
satisfied and can be skipped.

"""v2.4.5 Phase 2 (T008) -- picker marks and auto-selection for downloaded models.

The operator asked that already-downloaded models be detected, selected on
load, and visibly marked, so a reinstall on a host that already holds its
models does not look like a fresh 194 GB download.

Every test injects its own `InstalledReport`. The page's default probe reads
the real model stores under the user's home, so a test relying on it would
pass or fail depending on what the developer had downloaded -- the same
host-dependence that made the v2.4.4 shuffle assertion flaky.

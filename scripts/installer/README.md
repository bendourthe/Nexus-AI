# Nexus AI Studio installer

The PyQt5 setup wizard that installs Nexus AI Studio: the VS Code extension, the Ollama runtime, Python venvs, the selected local models, and the desktop app. Built into a one-file `NexusSetup.exe` via PyInstaller (`build/build-windows.ps1`).

## v2.4.1 reliability contract

The Installing page gives the overall operation a visually larger bar than its phase rows, displays a monotonic percentage, and uses a reduced-motion-safe animated gradient. The engine persists completed work for repair runs and turns optional-component exceptions into in-window failures with a log path instead of terminating the wizard.

PyInstaller must freeze every optional file consumed at runtime. `build/nexus-installer.spec` includes the Unsloth pin manifest and diffusion wheel/runtime inputs; packaging tests fail when those files are missing. Unsloth remains opt-in. Selecting an image model provisions or repairs the diffusion venv through a staged replacement, and readiness is written only after required weights and a CUDA-capable torch probe pass. A CPU-only torch build is not reported as ready merely because another runtime can see NVIDIA VRAM.

The installer and Settings consume the same canonical catalog order and display facts. Model cards always show a one-sentence summary, storage size as a pill, and VRAM beside Compatible/Incompatible. The installer does not invent metadata for external weights.

## Running from source

```bash
# from repo root, using the installer venv
scripts/installer/.venv/Scripts/python -m nexus_installer            # launch the wizard
```

## Diagnostic / preflight commands

The catalog the wizard offers is verified with two model-source checks (`nexus_installer.engine.model_preflight`):

- **`nexus-installer --reachability`** - fast, no-download probe that classifies every catalog model's source as OK / GATED / DEAD / UNKNOWN (a HEAD on the Hugging Face `resolve` URL, or an Ollama registry manifest check). Safe to run on every change; use it to catch catalog rot (a withdrawn or moved repo) before a release. Runs in well under a minute.
- **`nexus-installer --preflight [TIER]`** - the live pull+load verification: for a hardware tier's default models (`cpu` / `8` / `12` / `16` / `24`, or all tiers when omitted) it pulls each model and then LOADS it (a one-token Ollama generation, or a Hugging Face weights integrity check). This downloads multi-GB weights and writes them into your Ollama / models root, so it is an operator action on a target box, gated behind `NEXUS_MODEL_PREFLIGHT=1`. Its CI leg is deferred under the GitHub Actions budget freeze.

```bash
scripts/installer/.venv/Scripts/python -m nexus_installer --reachability
NEXUS_MODEL_PREFLIGHT=1 scripts/installer/.venv/Scripts/python -m nexus_installer --preflight 16
```

## Gated (license) models

A few offered models are open-weight but sit behind a Hugging Face license click-through (`gated: true` + `requiresLicense` in `core/registry/catalog.json`): currently `sana-1.6b-int4`. The installer makes them work rather than skipping them:

1. **Automatic** - it resolves a Hugging Face token from `HF_TOKEN` / `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN` or the `huggingface-cli login` cache (`engine.hf_auth.discover_hf_token`) and uses it silently.
2. **Guided (last resort)** - if no token is found and you selected a gated model, a one-time dialog (`widgets.gated_auth_dialog`) opens the model's license page, lets you paste a free read token, validates it against the repo, and proceeds. Declining removes that model from the install queue so nothing fails mid-download.

The default (recommended) model set is 100% public, so a normal install never needs a token. The guided dialog explains what a gated model is, links directly to the Hugging Face token settings, and makes clear that Skip omits only that one model and continues.

## Model catalog

The models the wizard offers come from `core/registry/catalog.json` (shared with the desktop app). The PyInstaller spec bundles this file straight from the repo, so a fresh build always ships the current catalog. To stop a *stale* catalog from shipping (an older build was the root of the v1.13/v1.14 install-reliability defects - a broken Gemma Ollama pull target and an unflagged gated model), the catalog is guarded by content invariants (`nexus_installer.catalog_invariants`):

- The build FAILS CLOSED (`build/nexus-installer.spec`) if `catalog.json` is missing or violates an invariant.
- `test_catalog_invariants.py` runs the same checks in CI (the installer pytest job) - the always-on gate.
- `python build/check-catalog.py` runs them ad hoc against `core/registry/catalog.json`.

The invariants encode the fixes: no model may use the known-broken `unsloth/gemma-4-12b-it-GGUF` Ollama reference, and known access-gated models (e.g. `sana-1.6b-int4`) must stay flagged `gated` with a reason / license URL so the guided token step can explain it and offer a clean skip.

v2.1.0: Muse Glimmer and Nemotron Lightning pair-invariants (both quant tiers must ship together). Entries with `hideBelowVramGB` are omitted from the picker when the host is below that floor, not merely grayed. `minOllamaVersion` shows a "Requires Ollama X+" badge; the catalog page does not hide on unknown Ollama version because that page often runs before Ollama is installed.

## Build

```powershell
scripts\installer\build\build-windows.ps1 -SkipSign   # -> dist\NexusSetup.exe
```

See `VERSIONS.md` for the pinned Ollama / payload versions and the minimum Ollama floor.
